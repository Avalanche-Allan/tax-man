### Who Must File

- Self-employed individuals with **net self-employment income of $400 or more** must file even if total income is below the normal threshold.
- Filing is required even if you qualify for the Foreign Earned Income Exclusion (FEIE) -- you must file to **claim** the exclusion.

### What to Report

- All worldwide income: wages, self-employment income, investment income, rental income, pensions, etc.
- Income must be reported in **U.S. dollars** using the exchange rate prevailing when income was received (or the yearly average rate).

### Where to File

- Paper returns: **Department of the Treasury, Internal Revenue Service, Austin, TX 73301-0215**
- E-filing is available and encouraged for taxpayers abroad.

## 2. Automatic 2-Month Extension (June 15 Deadline)

### Automatic Extension

If your **tax home** is outside the United States and Puerto Rico on the regular due date, **or** you are in military or naval service on duty outside the United States and Puerto Rico on the regular due date, you are allowed an automatic **2-month extension** to file your return and pay any tax due.

- **Regular due date:** April 15, 2026 (for tax year 2025)
- **Extended due date:** June 15, 2026

### Important Rules

- **No form is required** to claim the automatic 2-month extension.
- Attach a statement to your return explaining which condition qualifies you.
- **Interest** still accrues on any tax due from the original April 15 due date, even though you have until June 15 to file.
- The late-payment penalty does not apply to the period covered by the extension if you pay by June 15.

### Further Extensions

- You can request an **additional extension to October 15, 2026** by filing **Form 4868** before June 15, 2026.
- If you expect to meet the bona fide residence or physical presence test but have not yet qualified by the due date, you can request an extension to **30 days beyond the date you expect to qualify** by filing Form 2350.

## 3. Foreign Earned Income Exclusion (FEIE)

The FEIE allows qualifying U.S. citizens and resident aliens to exclude foreign earned income from U.S. taxation. For **tax year 2025**, the maximum exclusion is **$130,000**.

### Qualifying Tests

You must have a **tax home** in a foreign country **and** meet one of the following tests:

#### Physical Presence Test (330 Days)

- You must be **physically present** in a foreign country or countries for at least **330 full days** during a period of **12 consecutive months**.
- The 12-month period can begin on any day -- it need not align with the calendar year.
- A "full day" means a period of 24 hours beginning at midnight. Days spent in transit between two foreign countries count, but days spent traveling over international waters do not.
- Brief trips to the United States (or elsewhere) reduce the count of qualifying days -- even a partial day in the United States breaks the "full day" requirement for that day.

#### Bona Fide Residence Test

- You must be a **bona fide resident** of a foreign country for an **uninterrupted period that includes an entire tax year** (January 1 through December 31).
- Determined by examining intent, purpose, and nature of stay -- not merely physical presence.
- Factors include: establishment of a home abroad, involvement in community, type of visa, nature of employment, and whether you maintained a U.S. abode.
- Brief trips to the United States do not necessarily break bona fide residence if the foreign home is maintained.
- You must be a **U.S. citizen** or a **U.S. resident alien who is a citizen or national of a country with which the U.S. has an income tax treaty**.

### Tax Home Requirement

Your **tax home** must be in a foreign country. Your tax home is generally the area of your main place of business or employment, regardless of where you maintain your family home. You are **not** considered to have a tax home in a foreign country if your abode remains in the United States (unless you are in a combat zone).

### What Qualifies as Foreign Earned Income

- Wages, salaries, professional fees, bonuses, commissions, tips
- Self-employment income for services performed abroad
- Noncash income (fair market value of employer-provided housing, meals, etc.)

### What Does NOT Qualify

- Pensions, annuities, Social Security benefits
- Dividends, interest, capital gains, rental income
- Payments from the U.S. government (including military pay)
- Amounts received after the tax year following the year in which services were performed
- Meals and lodging excluded under IRC Section 119

### Claiming the FEIE

- File **Form 2555** (Foreign Earned Income) with your tax return.
- You may **revoke** the FEIE election, but if you do, you **cannot re-elect FEIE for 5 tax years** without IRS approval.
- If you do not file Form 2555 on a timely-filed return (including extensions), you may still make the election on a late-filed return or amended return if you owed no tax that was unpaid.
- Pro rata rule: if your qualifying period does not cover the full year, the maximum exclusion is prorated on a daily basis ($130,000 / 365 x qualifying days).

## 4. Foreign Housing Exclusion and Deduction

In addition to the FEIE, you may exclude or deduct certain foreign housing expenses.

### Housing Exclusion (Employees)

Applies to amounts paid with **employer-provided funds** (wages, salary, or employer-paid housing).

### Housing Deduction (Self-Employed)

Applies to amounts paid with **self-employment earnings**. Taken as an adjustment to gross income (above-the-line deduction).

### Calculation for 2025

| Component | Amount |
|---|---|
| Maximum FEIE | $130,000 |
| Base housing amount (16% of FEIE) | $20,800 |
| Default housing limit (30% of FEIE) | $39,000 |
| Maximum default housing expenses above base | $18,200 |

- **Qualified housing expenses** minus the **base housing amount** ($20,800) equals the housing exclusion or deduction.
- The total housing expenses cannot exceed **$39,000** for most locations (30% of $130,000).
- **High-cost locations** have adjusted higher limits published annually in IRS notices (see **IRS Notice 2025-16** for 2025 high-cost location limits).

### Qualified Housing Expenses

**Included:**
- Rent, utilities (except telephone), real and personal property insurance
- Occupancy taxes not deductible under Section 164
- Nonrefundable security deposits, lease rental fees
- Furniture rental, residential parking

**Excluded:**
- Mortgage payments, home purchase costs, purchased furniture
- Domestic labor (maids, gardeners)
- Pay TV, improvements that increase property value
- Lavish or extravagant expenses

### Proration

If your qualifying period does not include the entire year, both the base housing amount and the housing limit are prorated on a daily basis.

### Carryforward

Unused housing deduction amounts (self-employed) can be carried forward to the **next tax year only**, subject to that year's limits.

## 5. Foreign Tax Credit vs. FEIE -- Choosing Between Them

### The Core Rule

You **cannot** claim both the Foreign Tax Credit (FTC) and the FEIE on the **same** income. However, you **can** use them on **different** categories of income -- for example, FEIE on earned income and FTC on passive income (dividends, interest).

### Foreign Tax Credit (Form 1116)

- Provides a dollar-for-dollar credit against U.S. tax for foreign income taxes paid or accrued.
- Generally more beneficial when foreign tax rates **exceed** U.S. rates (because FTC offsets U.S. tax directly).
- Excess credits can be **carried back 1 year** and **carried forward 10 years**.
- Separate Forms 1116 required for each income category (general, passive, etc.).

### When FEIE Is Typically Better

- You live in a **low-tax or no-tax country** (e.g., UAE, Bahamas, Singapore for most income types).
- Your foreign earned income is below or near $130,000.
- FEIE eliminates the income entirely from U.S. taxation; no foreign tax payment required to benefit.

### When FTC Is Typically Better

- You live in a **high-tax country** (e.g., many European countries, Japan, Australia).
- Foreign taxes paid exceed the U.S. tax that would be due on that income.
- Excess credits can offset tax in other years via carryback/carryforward.

### The 5-Year Revocation Rule

If you revoke the FEIE election (by not filing Form 2555 when you have eligible foreign earned income), you **cannot re-elect the FEIE for 5 tax years** without obtaining IRS approval via a private letter ruling.

### Interaction

- Income excluded under FEIE is **removed** from the FTC limitation calculation (effectively "stacking" remaining income at higher marginal rates).
- You may claim FTC on income that is **not** excluded under FEIE (e.g., foreign-source investment income, income exceeding the $130,000 FEIE cap).

---

## 6. Self-Employment Tax Abroad

### General Rule

U.S. citizens and resident aliens are subject to **self-employment tax** (SE tax) on net self-employment income regardless of where they live or perform services.

- SE tax rate: **15.3%** (12.4% Social Security + 2.9% Medicare)
- Social Security wage base for 2025: **$176,100**
- Additional Medicare tax: **0.9%** on SE income exceeding $200,000 (single) / $250,000 (MFJ)

### FEIE Does NOT Reduce SE Tax

The FEIE excludes income from **income tax** only. Self-employment income excluded under the FEIE is **still subject to the full 15.3% SE tax**. You must still file **Schedule SE** and pay SE tax on the full net SE income.

### Exceptions

- If you are subject to the social security system of a **foreign country with a totalization agreement** and can document coverage, you may be **exempt from U.S. SE tax** (see Section 7 below).
- If local law of a foreign country **requires** you to participate in that country's social security system, a totalization agreement may exempt you from dual coverage.

---

## 7. Tax Treaties and Totalization Agreements

### Tax Treaties

- The United States has **income tax treaties** with numerous countries that may reduce or eliminate double taxation.
- Treaty benefits may reduce withholding rates on dividends, interest, royalties, and pensions.
- Treaties may provide **tie-breaker rules** for dual-resident taxpayers.
- If you claim a treaty-based position that reduces your U.S. tax, you must disclose it on **Form 8833** (Treaty-Based Return Position Disclosure).
- Treaty benefits generally **cannot** be used to reduce tax on income excluded under the FEIE.

### Totalization Agreements (Social Security)

Bilateral agreements between the U.S. and foreign countries that **prevent dual Social Security/self-employment taxation**.

**How they work:**
- If you are **temporarily** working abroad (generally up to 5 years), you generally remain covered **only** by the U.S. Social Security system.
- If you are **permanently** employed abroad, you generally pay into **only** the foreign country's system and are exempt from U.S. SE tax.
- To claim exemption, obtain a **Certificate of Coverage** from the appropriate country's social security agency.

**Countries with totalization agreements (as of 2025):** Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Slovak Republic, Slovenia, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom, Uruguay.

## 8. Estimated Tax Requirements for Taxpayers Abroad

### General Requirements

Taxpayers abroad are subject to the **same estimated tax rules** as domestic taxpayers (see Publication 505):

- Estimated tax is required if you expect to owe **$1,000 or more** in tax after subtracting withholding and credits.
- Payments are due quarterly: **April 15, June 15, September 15, January 15**.

### Special Rules for Taxpayers Abroad

- If you qualify for the automatic **2-month extension** (tax home abroad), your first estimated tax payment is still due **April 15** -- the extension applies only to filing and paying the balance due.
- If you expect to qualify for the FEIE but have not yet met the time requirements, you may **estimate** the exclusion when computing estimated tax. If you ultimately do not qualify, you will owe additional tax plus interest.
- The **safe harbor** rules apply: pay at least 100% of prior-year tax (110% if AGI exceeded $150,000) or 90% of current-year tax to avoid underpayment penalties.

### Penalty Exceptions

- No penalty for the first year you have a filing requirement as a U.S. person abroad.
- No penalty if you show reasonable cause and not willful neglect.
- The IRS may waive the penalty in cases of casualty, disaster, or other unusual circumstances.

## 9. FBAR and FATCA Reporting

### FBAR -- FinCEN Form 114 (Report of Foreign Bank and Financial Accounts)

|---|---|---|
| Filed with | FinCEN (separate from tax return) | IRS (attached to Form 1040) |
| Threshold | $10,000 aggregate | $50,000--$400,000 (varies) |
| Assets covered | Financial accounts only | Financial accounts + other specified assets |
| Penalty for non-filing | Civil and criminal penalties | $10,000 per failure + continuation penalties |

## 10. Combat Zone Exclusions

### Military Personnel

Members of the Armed Forces serving in a **designated combat zone** may exclude from gross income:

- **Enlisted members:** All military compensation received while serving in the combat zone (no dollar limit).
- **Officers:** Military compensation up to the **highest enlisted pay** plus imminent danger/hostile fire pay for each month of service in the combat zone.
- The exclusion applies for any month in which the member served in the combat zone for **even one day**.

### Civilian Contractors in Combat Zones

- Civilian employees and contractors providing support to U.S. Armed Forces in designated combat zones **qualify for the FEIE** (up to $130,000 for 2025).
- The special rule: you are not considered to lack a foreign tax home merely because your abode is in the United States if you are serving in a combat zone in support of the Armed Forces.
- Federal civilian employees and military members **cannot** claim the FEIE (they may be eligible for the combat zone exclusion instead).

### Designated Combat Zones (2025)

Include areas such as the Arabian Peninsula, Afghanistan, Kosovo, and the Sinai Peninsula, among others as designated by Executive Order.

---

## 11. Foreign Employer Exclusions

### Employer-Provided Meals and Lodging (IRC Section 119)

- **Meals** furnished on the employer's business premises for the employer's convenience.
- **Lodging** furnished on the employer's business premises, for the employer's convenience, and as a condition of employment.

This exclusion is **separate from and in addition to** the FEIE. Income excluded under Section 119 is **not** counted toward the $130,000 FEIE limit.

### Camps in Hardship Areas

If you live in a **camp** provided by your employer in a foreign country because housing is not available on the open market due to the remote or harsh nature of the location:

- The value of the camp housing may be excluded from income under Section 119.
- The camp must be located as close as practicable to the work site, in an area where satisfactory housing is not available on the open market, and provided in a common area (or enclave) not available to the general public.

### Foreign Government Employers

- If you are employed by a **foreign government**, your compensation may be exempt from U.S. tax under certain conditions and treaty provisions.
