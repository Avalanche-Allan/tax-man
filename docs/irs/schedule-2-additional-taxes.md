## Overview

Schedule 2 (Form 1040), "Additional Taxes," is attached to Form 1040 when the
taxpayer owes taxes beyond the regular income tax calculated on Form 1040. It was
introduced as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (2017) restructuring of the Form 1040
system. The totals from Schedule 2 flow to:

- **Form 1040, Line 17** -- Part I total (AMT and excess premium tax credit repayment)
- **Form 1040, Line 23** -- Part II total (other taxes)

Schedule 2 is required if you owe any of the following: alternative minimum tax, excess
advance premium tax credit repayment, self-employment tax, Additional Medicare Tax,
Net Investment Income Tax, household employment taxes, early distribution penalties
from retirement accounts, first-time homebuyer credit repayment, or various other
specialized taxes.
