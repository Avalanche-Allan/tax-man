## Overview

Form 4868, "Application for Automatic Extension of Time to File U.S. Individual Income Tax Return," grants an **automatic 6-month extension** of the filing deadline for Form 1040 (and related returns). The extension is automatic -- no reason or explanation is required.

**Key principle:** Form 4868 is an extension of time to **file**, not an extension of time to **pay**. Taxes owed are still due by the original filing deadline.

---

## 1. Extension Deadlines

| Event | Date (2025 Tax Year) |
|-------|---------------------|
| Original filing deadline | **April 15, 2026** |
| Form 4868 due date | **April 15, 2026** |
| Extended filing deadline | **October 15, 2026** |

- If the due date falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, the deadline is extended to the next business day.
- The extension applies to Form 1040, Form 1040-SR, Form 1040-NR, Form 1040-SS, and Form 1040-PR.

## 2. How to File Form 4868

### Electronic Filing (Preferred)

| Method | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **IRS Free File** | Available to all individual filers regardless of income at IRS.gov/FreeFile. Request an extension and make a payment (if applicable). |
| **IRS Direct Pay** | Pay all or part of estimated tax at IRS.gov/DirectPay. Selecting "Extension" as the reason automatically files Form 4868. |
| **EFTPS** | Electronic Federal Tax Payment System (eftps.gov). Indicate the payment is for an extension. |
| **Credit/Debit Card** | Pay via IRS-authorized payment processors. Select "extension" as payment type. |
| **Tax Software** | Most tax preparation software (e.g., TurboTax, H&R Block) can e-file Form 4868. |
| **Tax Professional** | A paid preparer can e-file on the taxpayer's behalf. |

*Note: Making an electronic payment and designating it as an extension payment satisfies the Form 4868 filing requirement -- no separate form submission is needed.*

### Paper Filing

- Complete Form 4868 and mail it to the IRS address listed in the instructions (address depends on state of residence).
- Must be **postmarked** by April 15, 2026.
- Include a check or money order for any estimated tax owed (payable to "United States Treasury").
- Write the taxpayer's SSN, daytime phone number, and "Form 4868" on the check.

## 3. Estimated Tax Payment with Extension

### Why Pay with the Extension

Although the extension extends the filing deadline, it does **not** extend the payment deadline. Any tax not paid by April 15, 2026 will accrue:
- **Failure-to-pay penalty** (see Section 5).
- **Interest** on the unpaid balance (see Section 5).

### Estimating the Tax Owed

Form 4868 requires an estimate of total tax liability for the year. To calculate:

1. Estimate total tax liability for 2025.
2. Subtract total payments already made (withholding, estimated tax payments, credits).
3. The difference is the **balance due** -- pay this amount with the extension.

| Form 4868 Line | Description |
|-----------------|-------------|
| Line 4 | Estimate of total tax liability for 2025. |
| Line 5 | Total 2025 payments (withholding + estimated tax + credits). |
| Line 6 | Balance due (Line 4 minus Line 5). This is the amount to pay. |
| Line 7 | Amount being paid with the extension. |

### Safe Harbor

To avoid the failure-to-pay penalty:
- Pay at least **90%** of the tax shown on the 2025 return by April 15, 2026; **or**
- Pay 100% of the tax shown on the 2024 return (110% if 2024 AGI exceeded $150,000).

## 4. Extension to File, NOT to Pay

This distinction is critical:

| Aspect | Extension Granted? |
|--------|-------------------|
| Time to file the return | **Yes** -- 6 months to October 15, 2026 |
| Time to pay taxes owed | **No** -- taxes are due April 15, 2026 |
| Failure-to-file penalty | **Eliminated** if filed by October 15, 2026 |
| Failure-to-pay penalty | **Still applies** on any unpaid balance after April 15, 2026 |
| Interest on underpayment | **Still accrues** from April 15, 2026 |

Filing the extension eliminates the failure-to-file penalty (which is much higher than the failure-to-pay penalty), so it is **always better to file the extension** than to miss the deadline entirely, even if the taxpayer cannot pay.

## 5. Interest and Penalties on Unpaid Tax

### Failure-to-Pay Penalty

| Item | Rate |
|------|------|
| Monthly rate | **0.5%** of unpaid tax per month (or partial month) |
| Maximum | **25%** of unpaid tax |
| Reduced rate | **0.25%** per month if the taxpayer filed the return by the due date (including extension) and has an approved installment agreement |
| Start date | Begins on **April 16, 2026** (the day after the original due date) |
| End date | Continues until the tax is paid in full or the maximum is reached |

### Failure-to-File Penalty (if extension is NOT filed)

| Item | Rate |
|------|------|
| Monthly rate | **5%** of unpaid tax per month (or partial month) |
| Maximum | **25%** of unpaid tax |
| Minimum penalty | If the return is more than 60 days late: the **lesser** of $525 or 100% of the unpaid tax |
| Combined rule | If both failure-to-file and failure-to-pay penalties apply in the same month, the failure-to-file penalty is reduced by the failure-to-pay penalty (net 4.5% + 0.5% = 5% total per month) |

*This is why filing Form 4868 is always advisable -- it eliminates the 5% per month failure-to-file penalty.*

### Interest on Underpayment

| Item | Details |
|------|---------|
| Rate | **Federal short-term rate + 3%** (determined quarterly by the IRS) |
| Compounding | Interest compounds **daily** |
| Start date | Begins on **April 16, 2026** |
| End date | Continues until the balance is paid in full |
| Deductibility | Interest on individual income tax is **not deductible** |

*Note: The interest rate changes quarterly. Check IRS.gov for the current rate.*

### Underpayment of Estimated Tax Penalty

- Separate from the failure-to-pay penalty, the **underpayment of estimated tax penalty** (Form 2210) may apply if the taxpayer did not make sufficient quarterly estimated tax payments during the year.
- The estimated tax penalty applies even if the taxpayer files on time and pays the full balance by April 15.
- See Publication 505 for estimated tax requirements.

## 6. Special Rules -- Taxpayers Abroad

### Automatic 2-Month Extension (to June 15)

Taxpayers who are **out of the country** on the original due date receive an **automatic 2-month extension** (to June 15, 2026) without filing Form 4868.

**Who qualifies:**
- U.S. citizens or resident aliens whose **tax home** is outside the United States and Puerto Rico; **or**
- U.S. citizens or resident aliens who are **in military or naval service on duty** outside the United States and Puerto Rico.

**Requirements:**
- The taxpayer must be outside the United States on April 15, 2026.
- Attach a statement to the return explaining qualification for the automatic extension.
- Interest still accrues from **April 15, 2026** on any unpaid balance (even during the automatic extension period).

### Additional Extension to October 15

- Taxpayers abroad who use the automatic June 15 extension can then file **Form 4868** by June 15, 2026 to receive an additional extension to **October 15, 2026**.
- The total extension period is the same 6 months -- the June 15 automatic extension simply delays the Form 4868 filing requirement.

### Further Extension Beyond October 15

- In rare cases, taxpayers abroad may request an additional extension beyond October 15 by filing a letter with the IRS before October 15 explaining the need. This is discretionary (not automatic).
- Taxpayers who expect to qualify for the **Foreign Earned Income Exclusion** (Form 2555) but have not yet met the bona fide residence or physical presence test may request an extension to a date after they expect to qualify (typically December 15 or later).

## 7. Combat Zone Extensions

### Who Qualifies

- Members of the U.S. Armed Forces who serve in a **combat zone** or **qualified hazardous duty area** (as designated by Executive Order or legislation).
- Personnel serving in **contingency operations** (as designated by the Secretary of Defense).
- Civilians serving in support of the Armed Forces in a combat zone (e.g., Red Cross personnel, accredited correspondents).

### Extension Period

The deadline for filing returns, paying tax, and taking other actions with the IRS is extended by:

1. **The number of days remaining** to take the action when the individual entered the combat zone (or began qualifying service); **plus**
2. **The entire period of service** in the combat zone (or qualified area); **plus**
3. **At least 180 days** after the last day of service in the combat zone (or the last day the area qualifies as a combat zone, whichever is earlier).

### Example

A service member enters a combat zone on March 1, 2026, with 45 days remaining until the April 15 filing deadline. The member leaves the combat zone on September 1, 2026.

- Days remaining at entry: 45 days
- Period of service: March 1 - September 1, 2026 (184 days)
- Additional 180 days after departure: September 2, 2026 + 180 days = March 1, 2027
- Extended deadline: March 1, 2027 + 45 days = approximately **April 15, 2027**

### What Is Extended

The combat zone extension applies to:
- Filing income tax returns.
- Paying income tax.
- Filing claims for refund.
- Filing claims for credit.
- Making contributions to IRAs and other retirement accounts.
- Filing petitions with the Tax Court.
- Any other time-sensitive action with the IRS.

### Current Combat Zone Designations (as of 2025)

Designated combat zones and qualified hazardous duty areas include:
- Afghanistan (and surrounding support areas)
- Arabian Peninsula areas (including Iraq, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Qatar, Oman, UAE)
- Sinai Peninsula (Egypt)
- Kosovo
- Other areas as designated by Executive Order

*Note: Check IRS.gov or consult current Executive Orders for the latest designations.*

## 8. Other Special Situations

### Disaster Area Extensions

- The IRS may postpone filing and payment deadlines for taxpayers affected by **federally declared disasters**.
- These extensions are announced via IRS News Releases and apply automatically to taxpayers in the designated disaster area.
- No form filing is required -- the IRS identifies affected taxpayers by ZIP code.

### Taxpayers in the U.S. Territories

- Taxpayers in Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa, or the Northern Mariana Islands may have different filing requirements and deadlines.
- Consult the specific territory's tax authority and IRS Publication 570.
