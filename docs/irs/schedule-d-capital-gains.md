## 2025 Instructions for Schedule D (Form 1040) - Capital Gains and Losses

Section references are to the Internal Revenue Code unless otherwise noted.

---

## Purpose of Schedule D

Use Schedule D (Form 1040) to report the following:

- The overall gain or loss from transactions reported on Form 8949 (Sales and Other Dispositions of Capital Assets)
- Certain transactions you do not have to report on Form 8949
- Capital gain distributions not reported directly on Form 1040 or 1040-SR, line 7
- Gains from involuntary conversions (other than from casualty or theft) of capital assets not held for business or profit

Schedule D has two main parts:
- **Part I** -- Short-Term Capital Gains and Losses (assets held one year or less)
- **Part II** -- Long-Term Capital Gains and Losses (assets held more than one year)

---

## Who Must File Schedule D

File Schedule D if you have any of the following:

1. You have capital gains or losses to report from sales or exchanges of capital assets
2. You have capital gain distributions from mutual funds or other regulated investment companies
3. You have a gain from Form 2439, Notice to Shareholder of Undistributed Long-Term Capital Gains
4. You have a gain or loss from Form 4684, 6781, or 8824
5. You have a gain or loss from a partnership, S corporation, estate, or trust
6. You have a capital loss carryover from a prior year
7. You need to compute the tax on qualified dividends or net capital gain using the Qualified Dividends and Capital Gain Tax Worksheet or the Schedule D Tax Worksheet

---

## Holding Period Rules

The distinction between short-term and long-term is critical because it determines the applicable tax rate.

### Short-Term (One Year or Less)

- You held the asset for **one year or less** before selling or exchanging it
- Short-term capital gains are taxed at **ordinary income tax rates** (up to 37% for 2025)
- Reported in **Part I** of Schedule D (Lines 1-7)

### Long-Term (More Than One Year)

- You held the asset for **more than one year** before selling or exchanging it
- Long-term capital gains are eligible for **preferential tax rates** (0%, 15%, or 20%)
- Reported in **Part II** of Schedule D (Lines 8-15)

### Determining the Holding Period

- The holding period begins on the **day after** you acquire the asset
- The holding period ends on the **day you dispose** of the asset
- For securities traded on an established market, the trade date (not settlement date) determines both acquisition and disposition dates
- If you acquire property by gift, your holding period includes the time the donor held the property (if your basis is determined by the donor's basis)
- If you inherit property, it is automatically considered long-term regardless of how long you or the decedent held it

## Capital Gains Tax Rates (2025)

### Standard Long-Term Capital Gains Rates

Long-term capital gains are taxed at three preferential rate tiers based on taxable income:

#### 0% Rate Threshold (Taxable Income Up To)

| Filing Status | 0% Rate Applies Up To |
|---|---|
| Single | $48,350 |
| Married Filing Jointly / Qualifying Surviving Spouse | $96,700 |
| Married Filing Separately | $48,350 |
| Head of Household | $64,750 |

#### 15% Rate

Applies to taxable income above the 0% threshold and up to the 20% threshold.

#### 20% Rate Threshold (Taxable Income Above)

| Filing Status | 20% Rate Applies Above |
|---|---|
| Single | $533,400 |
| Married Filing Jointly / Qualifying Surviving Spouse | $600,050 |
| Married Filing Separately | $300,025 |
| Head of Household | $566,700 |

### Special Capital Gains Rates

Certain types of long-term capital gains are taxed at rates different from the standard 0%/15%/20% structure:

#### Collectibles -- 28% Maximum Rate

Net capital gains from selling **collectibles** are taxed at a maximum rate of **28%**. Collectibles include:

- Works of art
- Rugs and antiques
- Metals (such as gold, silver, platinum)
- Gems and stamps
- Coins
- Alcoholic beverages (wines, etc.)
- Any other tangible personal property specified by the IRS

If your ordinary income tax rate is below 28%, the collectibles gain is taxed at your ordinary rate instead. The 28% rate is a maximum, not a flat rate.

#### Unrecaptured Section 1250 Gain -- 25% Maximum Rate

**Unrecaptured Section 1250 gain** is the portion of gain attributable to depreciation previously claimed on Section 1250 property (generally depreciable real property such as buildings). This gain is taxed at a maximum rate of **25%**.

Key points:
- Section 1250 property is generally real property that you depreciated (e.g., rental buildings, commercial structures)
- The unrecaptured gain equals the lesser of the depreciation allowed (or allowable) or the gain on the sale
- Must be held more than one year to qualify for the 25% rate (otherwise taxed as ordinary income at short-term rates)
- You must complete the **Unrecaptured Section 1250 Gain Worksheet** in the Schedule D instructions if applicable
- If your ordinary tax rate is below 25%, the gain is taxed at your ordinary rate

#### Qualified Small Business Stock -- Section 1202

Gain from the sale of qualified small business stock (Section 1202 stock) may be partially or fully excludable:
- **50% exclusion** for stock acquired before February 18, 2009
- **75% exclusion** for stock acquired after February 17, 2009, and before September 28, 2010
- **100% exclusion** for stock acquired after September 27, 2010
- The non-excluded portion is taxed at a maximum rate of 28%

---

## Qualified Dividends

Qualified dividends are taxed at the same preferential rates as long-term capital gains (0%, 15%, or 20%). Although qualified dividends are reported on Form 1040, line 3a (not on Schedule D), the Schedule D instructions provide the **Qualified Dividends and Capital Gain Tax Worksheet** used to compute the tax.

### Requirements for Qualified Dividends

- The dividend must be paid by a U.S. corporation or a qualified foreign corporation
- The dividend must not be listed among the types that do not qualify (e.g., dividends from tax-exempt organizations, certain dividends from cooperatives, etc.)
- You must meet the **holding period requirement**: you must have held the stock for more than 60 days during the 121-day period beginning 60 days before the ex-dividend date (for preferred stock with dividends attributable to periods over 366 days, the holding period is 90 days within a 181-day window)

---

## Capital Loss Rules

### Capital Loss Deduction Limit

If your capital losses exceed your capital gains for the year, you can deduct the excess loss against ordinary income, subject to an annual limit:

| Filing Status | Annual Capital Loss Deduction Limit |
|---|---|
| Single | $3,000 |
| Married Filing Jointly | $3,000 |
| Married Filing Separately | **$1,500** |
| Head of Household | $3,000 |
| Qualifying Surviving Spouse | $3,000 |

### Capital Loss Carryover Rules

If your net capital loss exceeds the annual deduction limit ($3,000 or $1,500 MFS), the excess is carried forward to future tax years **indefinitely** (there is no expiration).

Key carryover rules:
- **Character is preserved:** Short-term losses remain short-term in the carryover year; long-term losses remain long-term
- **Ordering:** Short-term losses are applied first against short-term gains, then long-term losses against long-term gains
- **Carryover calculation:** Use the **Capital Loss Carryover Worksheet** in the Schedule D instructions to compute the carryover amount
- **No carryback:** Capital losses cannot be carried back to prior tax years for individuals (only forward)
- **Death of taxpayer:** Capital loss carryovers are not transferable to the decedent's estate or surviving spouse; they expire upon death

### Netting Rules

Capital gains and losses are netted in a specific order:
1. Short-term gains and losses are netted against each other
2. Long-term gains and losses are netted against each other
3. If one category has a net gain and the other a net loss, they offset each other
4. The result determines whether you have a net capital gain (taxed at preferential rates if long-term) or a net capital loss (subject to the $3,000/$1,500 deduction limit)

## Wash Sale Rule

### Basic Rule (IRC Section 1091)

If you sell a security at a loss and buy the same or a **substantially identical** security within a **61-day window** (30 days before through 30 days after the sale date), the loss is **disallowed** for tax purposes.

### Key Details

- **Window:** 30 calendar days before and 30 calendar days after the date of the loss sale (61 total days)
- **Substantially identical:** The IRS has not provided a precise definition, but it generally includes the same stock or security, options or contracts to acquire the same stock, and mutual funds/ETFs that track the same index in the same way
- **Basis adjustment:** The disallowed loss is added to the cost basis of the replacement security
- **Holding period adjustment:** The holding period of the original security is added to the holding period of the replacement security
- **Scope:** The rule applies across all of your accounts (brokerage, IRA, 401(k), spouse's accounts, and accounts in entities you control)
- **Reporting:** Wash sales are reported on Form 8949, with the disallowed loss entered in column (g) using adjustment code "W"

### What Triggers a Wash Sale

- Buying substantially identical stock or securities
- Acquiring substantially identical stock or securities in a fully taxable trade
- Acquiring a contract or option to buy substantially identical stock or securities
- Acquiring substantially identical stock for your IRA or Roth IRA

### What Does NOT Trigger a Wash Sale

- Selling at a gain (the rule only applies to losses)
- Buying a security in a different company or sector
- Waiting more than 30 days after the sale to repurchase

## Section 1231 Gains and Losses

### What Is Section 1231 Property

Section 1231 property includes depreciable property and real property used in a trade or business and held for more than one year. It also includes certain involuntary conversions of business property and capital assets held in connection with a trade or business.

### Tax Treatment

- **Net Section 1231 gain** is treated as a **long-term capital gain** and is reported on Schedule D
- **Net Section 1231 loss** is treated as an **ordinary loss** (not subject to the $3,000 capital loss limitation)
- Section 1231 gains and losses are first computed on **Form 4797** (Sales of Business Property), and net gains flow to Schedule D

### Section 1231 Lookback Rule

If you had net Section 1231 losses in any of the prior 5 tax years that were treated as ordinary losses, any current-year net Section 1231 gain is recharacterized as **ordinary income** to the extent of those prior unrecaptured losses. This prevents taxpayers from getting ordinary loss treatment in loss years and capital gain treatment in gain years.

### Interaction with Unrecaptured Section 1250

A sale of Section 1231 real property may result in both:
- **Unrecaptured Section 1250 gain** (taxed at a maximum of 25%) for the depreciation portion
- **Remaining Section 1231 gain** (taxed at long-term capital gains rates of 0%/15%/20%) for the appreciation portion

## Net Investment Income Tax (NIIT) -- 3.8% Surtax

### Overview

In addition to regular capital gains tax, high-income taxpayers may owe the **3.8% Net Investment Income Tax** (NIIT) under IRC Section 1411, reported on **Form 8960**.

### MAGI Thresholds (2025)

The NIIT applies to the **lesser of** your net investment income or the amount by which your modified adjusted gross income (MAGI) exceeds the applicable threshold:

| Filing Status | MAGI Threshold |
|---|---|
| Single | $200,000 |
| Married Filing Jointly / Qualifying Surviving Spouse | $250,000 |
| Married Filing Separately | $125,000 |
| Head of Household | $200,000 |

**Note:** These thresholds are **not indexed for inflation** and have remained unchanged since the NIIT was enacted in 2013.

### What Is Net Investment Income

Net investment income includes:
- Interest, dividends, annuities, royalties, and rents (unless derived from an active trade or business)
- Capital gains (including short-term and long-term, and gains from the sale of property)
- Income from passive activities
- Income from trading in financial instruments or commodities

Net investment income does **not** include:
- Wages and self-employment income
- Unemployment compensation
- Social Security benefits
- Active trade or business income
- Distributions from qualified retirement plans (IRAs, 401(k)s, etc.)
- Tax-exempt interest income

### Effective Maximum Rates (Including NIIT)

When the NIIT applies, the effective maximum rates on investment income are:

| Type of Gain | Base Rate | With NIIT |
|---|---|---|
| Short-term capital gains | 37% | 40.8% |
| Long-term capital gains | 20% | 23.8% |
| Collectibles gain | 28% | 31.8% |
| Unrecaptured Section 1250 gain | 25% | 28.8% |
| Qualified dividends | 20% | 23.8% |

## Schedule D Tax Computation

### Part III -- Summary (Lines 16-22)

Lines 16-22 of Schedule D combine Parts I and II to determine your overall capital gain or loss position and which tax computation method to use.

- **Line 16:** Combine Parts I and II net results
- **Line 17:** If Line 16 is a gain, check "Yes" if you have qualified dividends on Form 1040 line 3a or need the 28% Rate Gain Worksheet or Unrecaptured Section 1250 Gain Worksheet
- **Lines 18-19:** Determine the proper tax computation method
- **Line 21:** If Line 16 is a loss, compute the allowable capital loss deduction (limited to $3,000 or $1,500 MFS)
- **Line 22:** Compute capital loss carryover using the Capital Loss Carryover Worksheet if Line 21 is ($3,000) or ($1,500 MFS)

### Tax Computation Worksheets

Depending on your situation, you may need one or more of these worksheets:

1. **Qualified Dividends and Capital Gain Tax Worksheet** -- Used by most filers with qualified dividends or net capital gain to compute tax at preferential rates
2. **Schedule D Tax Worksheet** -- Used if you have 28% rate gain (collectibles) or unrecaptured Section 1250 gain
3. **28% Rate Gain Worksheet** -- Used to compute the portion of gain taxable at the 28% maximum rate
4. **Unrecaptured Section 1250 Gain Worksheet** -- Used to compute the portion of gain taxable at the 25% maximum rate

---

## Reporting Requirements

### Form 8949
