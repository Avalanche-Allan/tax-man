## 1. Who Must Pay Estimated Tax

You must pay estimated tax for 2025 if **both** of the following apply:

1. You expect to owe **at least $1,000** in tax for 2025, after subtracting your withholding and refundable credits.
2. You expect your withholding and refundable credits to be **less than the smaller of:**
   - **90%** of the tax to be shown on your 2025 return, **or**
   - **100%** of the tax shown on your 2024 return (the return must cover all 12 months).

> **High-income exception:** If your 2024 AGI was more than **$150,000** ($75,000 if Married Filing Separately), substitute **110%** for 100% in the second bullet above.

### Who Does NOT Need to Pay Estimated Tax

- You had **no tax liability** for the prior year (2024), you were a U.S. citizen or resident alien for the whole year, and your prior-year return covered a 12-month period.
- U.S. citizens and resident aliens who had no tax liability for the prior year.

### Types of Income That Typically Require Estimated Payments

- Self-employment income (Schedule C, Schedule SE)
- Dividends and interest
- Capital gains
- Rental income and royalties
- Alimony (for pre-2019 agreements)
- Prizes, awards, gambling winnings
- Any income not subject to withholding

## 2. Safe Harbor Rules

The safe harbor rules allow taxpayers to avoid the underpayment penalty entirely. You will **not** owe a penalty if you meet **any one** of the following:

### Safe Harbor Test 1 -- Current Year (90% Rule)

Pay at least **90% of the tax shown on your 2025 return** through withholding and/or estimated tax payments.

### Safe Harbor Test 2 -- Prior Year (100% / 110% Rule)

Pay at least **100% of the tax shown on your 2024 return** through withholding and/or estimated tax payments.

**However**, if your 2024 AGI exceeded the high-income threshold, you must pay at least **110%** of the prior year's tax liability:

| Filing Status | High-Income AGI Threshold | Required Prior-Year % |
|---|---|---|
| Single | $150,000 | 110% |
| Married Filing Jointly (MFJ) | $150,000 | 110% |
| Married Filing Separately (MFS) | $75,000 | 110% |
| Head of Household (HOH) | $150,000 | 110% |
| Qualifying Surviving Spouse (QSS) | $150,000 | 110% |

> **Key Point:** The prior-year safe harbor requires that the prior year's return covered all 12 months. If you filed a short-year return, you cannot use this method.

### Safe Harbor Test 3 -- De Minimis Rule ($1,000 Threshold)

You owe **no penalty** if the total tax shown on your return minus withholding and refundable credits is **less than $1,000**.

## 3. Quarterly Due Dates for Estimated Tax Payments (Tax Year 2025)

Estimated tax is paid in four installments. Each installment covers income earned during a specific period:

| Payment | Income Period Covered | Due Date |
|---|---|---|
| Q1 (1st installment) | January 1 -- March 31, 2025 | **April 15, 2025** |
| Q2 (2nd installment) | April 1 -- May 31, 2025 | **June 16, 2025** (June 15 is a Sunday) |
| Q3 (3rd installment) | June 1 -- August 31, 2025 | **September 15, 2025** |
| Q4 (4th installment) | September 1 -- December 31, 2025 | **January 15, 2026** |

> **Weekend/Holiday Rule:** If a due date falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, the payment is timely if made on the next business day.

> **No Q4 Payment Needed:** If you file your 2025 return by **January 31, 2026** and pay all remaining tax due with the return, you do not need to make the Q4 estimated payment.

### Equal Installment Method

Under the standard method, each quarterly payment should be **25% of your required annual payment** (i.e., the lesser of 90% of 2025 tax or 100%/110% of 2024 tax, divided by four).

## 4. How to Figure Estimated Tax

To calculate your required estimated tax, use the worksheet in **Form 1040-ES**:

1. **Estimate your 2025 AGI** -- include all expected income sources.
2. **Estimate your 2025 deductions** -- standard deduction or itemized deductions.
3. **Calculate expected taxable income** -- AGI minus deductions.
4. **Apply the 2025 tax rates** to determine expected tax liability.
5. **Add self-employment tax** (Schedule SE) if applicable.
6. **Add Additional Medicare Tax** (0.9%) if applicable.
7. **Add Net Investment Income Tax** (3.8%) if applicable.
8. **Subtract expected credits** -- child tax credit, education credits, etc.
9. **The result is your expected tax liability.**
10. **Subtract expected withholding** from wages (W-2) and other sources.
11. **The remainder** is the amount you must pay through estimated tax payments.

## 5. Underpayment Penalty Rules (Form 2210)

### When the Penalty Applies

The underpayment penalty applies if you did not pay enough estimated tax for any payment period. The penalty is calculated **separately for each quarter** -- you can owe a penalty for one quarter even if you overpaid in another.

### Penalty Rate

The penalty rate equals the **federal short-term interest rate plus 3 percentage points**, determined quarterly by the IRS:

| Period (2025) | Penalty Rate |
|---|---|
| Q1 (Jan -- Mar 2025) | 7% |
| Q2 (Apr -- Jun 2025) | 7% |
| Q3 (Jul -- Sep 2025) | 7% |
| Q4 (Oct -- Dec 2025) | 7% |

> The rate is compounded daily and applied to the underpaid amount for each quarter from the payment due date until the earlier of the payment date or April 15, 2026.

### How the Penalty Is Calculated

For each quarter:

```
Penalty = (Underpayment Amount) x (Daily Penalty Rate) x (Number of Days)
```

Where:
- **Underpayment Amount** = Required installment minus actual payment for that quarter
- **Daily Penalty Rate** = Annual rate / 365
- **Number of Days** = Days from due date of installment to the earlier of: (a) the date the underpayment is paid, or (b) April 15 of the following year

## 6. Exceptions and Waivers

### Automatic Exceptions (No Penalty Owed)

1. **De minimis exception:** Balance due (tax minus withholding and credits) is **less than $1,000**.
2. **No prior-year liability:** You had no tax liability on your 2024 return and you were a U.S. citizen or resident for all of 2024.
3. **Withholding satisfied safe harbor:** Your withholding alone meets the 90% current-year or 100%/110% prior-year threshold.

### Waiver for Reasonable Cause

The IRS may waive all or part of the penalty if:

- You **retired after reaching age 62** during 2024 or 2025 and the underpayment was due to reasonable cause.
- You **became disabled** during 2024 or 2025 and the underpayment was due to reasonable cause.
- The underpayment was caused by a **casualty, disaster, or other unusual circumstance** and it would be inequitable to impose the penalty.
- The underpayment was due to a **federally declared disaster**.

> Use **Part III of Form 2210** to request a waiver.

### Farmers and Fishermen Exception

If at least **two-thirds** of your gross income is from farming or fishing:
- You only need to make **one** estimated tax payment (by January 15).
- You can avoid the penalty entirely by filing your return and paying all tax by **March 1**.
- Use **Form 2210-F** instead of Form 2210.

## 7. Annualized Income Installment Method

If your income is **received unevenly** during the year (e.g., large capital gain in Q4, seasonal business), you may be able to **reduce or avoid** the penalty by using the annualized income installment method.

### How It Works

Instead of assuming 25% of annual income in each quarter, you:

1. Calculate your **actual income, deductions, and credits** for each annualization period.
2. Annualize the income for that period to determine what the tax would be for a full year.
3. Compare the annualized required payment to what you actually paid.

### Annualization Periods

| Installment | Annualization Period | Annualization Factor |
|---|---|---|
| 1st (Apr 15) | Jan 1 -- Mar 31 | x 4 (3 months) |
| 2nd (Jun 16) | Jan 1 -- May 31 | x 2.4 (5 months) |
| 3rd (Sep 15) | Jan 1 -- Aug 31 | x 1.5 (8 months) |
| 4th (Jan 15) | Jan 1 -- Dec 31 | x 1 (12 months) |

### When to Use This Method

- You have **seasonal income** or irregular self-employment earnings.
- You realize a **large capital gain** late in the year.
- You receive a **bonus or lump-sum payment** in a specific quarter.
- Complete **Schedule AI (Form 2210)** to compute the penalty using this method.

## 8. Payment Methods

Estimated tax payments can be made via:

- **IRS Direct Pay** (irs.gov/directpay) -- free bank transfer
- **Electronic Federal Tax Payment System (EFTPS)** -- eftps.gov
- **IRS2Go mobile app**
- **Credit or debit card** (processing fees apply)
- **Check or money order** mailed with Form 1040-ES voucher
- **Cash** at IRS retail partners

> Use **EFTPS** to schedule payments in advance and track payment history.

---

## 9. Coordination with Withholding

If you have both wage income (subject to withholding) and non-wage income (requiring estimated payments), you can adjust your W-4 withholding to cover some or all of the estimated tax obligation.

**Key advantage:** Withholding is treated as paid **evenly throughout the year**, regardless of when it was actually withheld. This means increasing your withholding late in the year can retroactively satisfy earlier quarterly requirements.

> This is a common strategy for taxpayers who realize late in the year they have underpaid estimated taxes -- increasing W-4 withholding in Q4 is treated as if paid ratably across all four quarters.
