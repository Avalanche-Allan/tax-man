## Overview

**Form 8938, Statement of Specified Foreign Financial Assets**, is the IRS form used to comply with the **Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA)** individual reporting requirements under IRC Section 6038D. FATCA was enacted as part of the HIRE Act of 2010 to combat offshore tax evasion.

Form 8938 requires certain U.S. taxpayers to report their **specified foreign financial assets** if the total value exceeds applicable thresholds. The form is **attached to the taxpayer's annual income tax return** (Form 1040, 1040-SR, or 1040-NR) and filed with the IRS.

**Critical Distinction:** Form 8938 is filed with the IRS as part of your tax return. It does **not** replace the FBAR (FinCEN Form 114), which is filed separately with FinCEN. You may be required to file both.

---

## Who Must File

### "Specified Individuals"

Form 8938 must be filed by **specified individuals** who have an interest in specified foreign financial assets and meet the applicable reporting threshold. A specified individual is:

- A U.S. citizen
- A resident alien of the United States for any part of the tax year
- A nonresident alien who makes an election to be treated as a resident alien for purposes of filing a joint return
- A nonresident alien who is a bona fide resident of American Samoa or Puerto Rico

### "Specified Domestic Entities"

Certain domestic entities (corporations, partnerships, trusts) that are formed or availed of for the purpose of holding foreign financial assets may also have filing obligations. This applies to entities that are closely held by specified individuals and hold foreign financial assets with aggregate value exceeding $50,000 on the last day of the tax year or $75,000 at any time during the year.

### Who Does NOT Need to File

- Taxpayers who are **not required to file a U.S. income tax return** for the year (regardless of the value of foreign assets)
- Taxpayers whose specified foreign financial assets are **below the applicable threshold**
- Taxpayers filing only Form 1040-PR or Form 1040-SS

---

## Filing Thresholds

The reporting thresholds vary based on **filing status** and whether you **live in the United States or abroad**.

### Taxpayers Living in the United States

| Filing Status | Year-End Threshold | Any-Time-During-Year Threshold |
|---------------|-------------------|-------------------------------|
| **Single / Married Filing Separately** | More than **$50,000** | More than **$75,000** |
| **Married Filing Jointly** | More than **$100,000** | More than **$150,000** |

### Taxpayers Living Abroad

Taxpayers qualify for the higher thresholds if they are a **bona fide resident** of a foreign country for an uninterrupted period that includes the entire tax year, or they are **present in a foreign country** for at least 330 full days during a period of 12 consecutive months that ends in the tax year.

| Filing Status | Year-End Threshold | Any-Time-During-Year Threshold |
|---------------|-------------------|-------------------------------|
| **Single / Married Filing Separately** | More than **$200,000** | More than **$300,000** |
| **Married Filing Jointly** | More than **$400,000** | More than **$600,000** |

### How the Threshold Works

- You must file if the total value of your specified foreign financial assets exceeds **either** the year-end threshold **or** the any-time-during-year threshold
- If you file a joint return, you combine the assets of **both spouses** to determine whether the threshold is met
- If married filing separately, each spouse applies the single/MFS threshold to their own assets
- Once the threshold is met, you report **all** specified foreign financial assets (not just those that caused you to exceed the threshold)

---

## Specified Foreign Financial Assets -- What IS Included

### Category 1: Foreign Financial Accounts

Financial accounts maintained by a **foreign financial institution** (i.e., a financial institution organized under the laws of a foreign country):

- **Depository accounts** -- savings, checking, time deposits
- **Custodial accounts** -- brokerage accounts holding securities or other financial instruments
- **Equity or debt interests** in a foreign financial institution (other than interests regularly traded on an established securities market)
- **Cash-value insurance contracts** or **annuity contracts** issued by a foreign financial institution

### Category 2: Other Specified Foreign Financial Assets

Assets NOT held in a financial account, including:

- **Stock or securities** issued by a non-U.S. person (e.g., shares of a foreign corporation, bonds issued by a foreign entity or government)
- **Financial instruments or contracts** with a non-U.S. issuer or counterparty (e.g., derivatives, swaps, options, forward contracts involving a foreign counterparty)
- **Interests in foreign entities** -- ownership interests in foreign partnerships, foreign LLCs, foreign trusts, foreign estates, or foreign corporations (to the extent not already stock/securities)
- **Foreign-issued insurance policies** or annuity contracts with a cash value
- **Foreign pension plans** and deferred compensation plans
- **Foreign hedge fund or private equity fund** interests

### Interests in Foreign Trusts and Estates

If you are a beneficiary of a foreign trust or foreign estate, your interest is a specified foreign financial asset. If you received a distribution from a foreign trust or estate, you must report the asset.

---

## What Is NOT a Specified Foreign Financial Asset

The following are specifically **excluded** from Form 8938 reporting:

### Financial Accounts at U.S. Institutions

- Accounts (including foreign-currency-denominated accounts) maintained at a **U.S. branch** of a foreign financial institution
- Accounts maintained at a **foreign branch or foreign affiliate of a U.S. financial institution** -- these are NOT specified foreign financial assets

### Directly Held Real Estate

- **Foreign real estate** held directly (e.g., a vacation home, rental property, or personal residence in a foreign country) is NOT reportable
- **However:** If the real estate is held through a **foreign entity** (e.g., a foreign LLC or foreign corporation), the ownership **interest in the entity** IS reportable (even though the real estate itself is not)

### Tangible Assets

- Art, antiques, jewelry, cars, collectibles, and other tangible personal property
- Precious metals (gold, silver) held directly

### Other Exclusions

- **Foreign currency** held directly (not in a financial account)
- **Social insurance benefits** -- rights to receive foreign social security, social insurance, or similar government program benefits
- **Interests in social security, social insurance, or other similar programs** of a foreign government
- **Tax-favored foreign retirement accounts** covered by an applicable income tax treaty may have modified reporting (check specific treaty provisions)

---

## Valuation of Assets

### General Rule

Report both the **maximum value** during the tax year and the **year-end value** of each specified foreign financial asset.

### How to Determine Value

- Use the **fair market value** of the asset in the currency in which it is denominated
- Convert to U.S. dollars using the **Treasury Financial Management Service exchange rate** for the last day of the tax year
- For financial accounts, use periodic account statements (at least annual) to determine the maximum value
- If you do not know the fair market value, use a **reasonable estimate** and check the "estimated" box on Form 8938

### Valuation of Interests in Foreign Entities

- If the value of your interest in a foreign entity is **not determinable**, report the value of your **pro-rata share** of the assets of the entity using the entity's most recent financial statements
- If no financial statements are available, report your **maximum value as zero** and disclose on the form that the value is not determinable

### Joint Ownership

- If you **jointly own** an asset with your spouse and file a **joint return**, report the entire value of the asset on the joint Form 8938
- If you jointly own an asset with your spouse and file **separately**, each spouse reports the **entire value** of the jointly owned asset
- If you jointly own an asset with a **non-spouse**, report the **entire value** of the asset (not just your proportional share)

---

## Where and When to File

- **Attach Form 8938 to your annual income tax return** (Form 1040, 1040-SR, or 1040-NR)
- File by the **due date of the return** (including extensions)
- If you obtain an extension to file your tax return, the Form 8938 deadline is also extended
- You **cannot** file Form 8938 separately from your tax return
- There is no separate e-filing system for Form 8938 (unlike the FBAR)

---

## Penalties for Failure to File

### Initial Penalty

- **$10,000** for failure to disclose specified foreign financial assets on Form 8938

### Continued Failure Penalty

- If the IRS sends a notice of failure to file and the taxpayer does not file within **90 days**, an additional penalty of **$10,000 for each 30-day period** (or fraction thereof) of continued non-compliance
- **Maximum additional penalty: $50,000** (bringing total potential penalty to **$60,000** for failure to file)

### Accuracy-Related Penalty

- An additional **40% accuracy-related penalty** applies to any underpayment of tax attributable to an undisclosed specified foreign financial asset (compared to the standard 20% accuracy-related penalty)
- This 40% penalty applies to the portion of the underpayment related to the unreported asset

### Criminal Penalties

- Willful failure to file may result in criminal prosecution under IRC Section 7203 (failure to file) or IRC Section 7206 (fraud and false statements)
- Penalties include fines and imprisonment

---

## Accuracy-Related Penalty and Statute of Limitations

### Extended Statute of Limitations

If you fail to file Form 8938 or omit certain information:

- The statute of limitations for assessment of tax related to specified foreign financial assets is extended to **6 years** after the return is filed (instead of the normal 3 years)
- This extended period applies to any tax return on which Form 8938 is required to be filed, regardless of whether the omission is related to an understatement of income

### Presumption of Aggregate Value

If the IRS determines you failed to file Form 8938 or provide required information, the IRS may determine the aggregate value of specified foreign financial assets. The taxpayer bears the burden of proving the value reported is correct.

---

## Reasonable Cause Exception

No penalty will be imposed if the failure to file is due to **reasonable cause** and not willful neglect.

### Factors Considered

- Whether the taxpayer made a good-faith effort to comply
- Whether the taxpayer took reasonable steps to determine the value of foreign assets
- Whether the taxpayer relied on professional tax advice
- The complexity of the taxpayer's financial situation

### Burden of Proof

The taxpayer must affirmatively demonstrate reasonable cause. Simply being unaware of the filing requirement is generally NOT sufficient reasonable cause.

---

## Duplicative Reporting -- Coordination with Other Forms

If a foreign financial asset is reported on another specified form, you **still** must report it on Form 8938, but you may provide **abbreviated information** by identifying the form on which the asset is reported.

### Other Forms That May Overlap

| Form | Asset Type |
|------|-----------|
| **FBAR (FinCEN 114)** | Foreign financial accounts |
| **Form 3520 / 3520-A** | Foreign trusts and gifts |
| **Form 5471** | Ownership in controlled foreign corporations |
| **Form 8865** | Interests in foreign partnerships |
| **Form 8621** | Passive foreign investment companies (PFICs) |

You must identify on Form 8938 that the asset has been reported on another form and provide the form number. This does not eliminate the requirement to list the asset on Form 8938.
