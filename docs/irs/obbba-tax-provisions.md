> **Public Law 119-21**, signed into law on **July 4, 2025**
>
> Also known as the "One, Big, Beautiful Bill Act" or the FY2025 Reconciliation Law

---

## Overview

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) is a comprehensive tax and spending reconciliation law that permanently extends and modifies many provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) of 2017, which were originally set to expire after December 31, 2025. The law also introduces several new tax benefits for individuals and businesses.

---

## 1. TCJA Provisions Made Permanent

The OBBBA makes the following TCJA provisions **permanent** (they were previously set to sunset after 2025):

- **Individual income tax rates:** The seven-bracket structure at 10%, 12%, 22%, 24%, 32%, 35%, and 37% (replacing the pre-TCJA rates of 10%, 15%, 25%, 28%, 33%, 35%, 39.6%).
- **Increased standard deduction** (see Section 2 below).
- **Section 199A Qualified Business Income Deduction** (see Section 7 below).
- **Child Tax Credit** enhancements (see Section 8 below).
- **Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT)** increased exemption amounts (see Section 9 below).
- **Estate and gift tax exemption** at elevated levels (see Section 10 below).
- **Elimination of personal exemptions** (replaced by higher standard deduction and CTC).
- **Limitation on excess business losses** for noncorporate taxpayers (Section 461(l)).

Additionally, the OBBBA restores or enhances several business provisions:

- **100% bonus depreciation** (see Section 6 below).
- **Section 179 expensing increase** (see Section 5 below).
- **Domestic R&D expensing** (Section 174 -- restores immediate expensing instead of 5-year amortization).
- **More generous business interest deduction** (Section 163(j) -- restores EBITDA-based limitation instead of EBIT).

---

## 2. Standard Deduction Amounts

The OBBBA preserves and slightly increases the expanded standard deduction. The amounts for **tax year 2025** are:

| Filing Status | Standard Deduction (2025) |
|---------------|--------------------------|
| Single | **$15,750** |
| Married Filing Separately (MFS) | **$15,750** |
| Married Filing Jointly (MFJ) | **$31,500** |
| Head of Household (HOH) | **$23,625** |
| Surviving Spouse | **$31,500** |

- These amounts are **indexed to inflation annually** going forward.
- The additional standard deduction for taxpayers age 65+ and/or blind continues to apply on top of these amounts.

### Senior Bonus Standard Deduction

The OBBBA introduces a **temporary $4,000 Senior Bonus Standard Deduction** for taxpayers age 65 and older for tax years 2025-2028. This is an additional amount on top of the regular standard deduction and the existing age-65+ additional standard deduction.

---

## 3. SALT Deduction Cap

The OBBBA significantly modifies the state and local tax (SALT) deduction cap:

| Tax Year | SALT Cap (General) | SALT Cap (MFS) |
|----------|-------------------|----------------|
| 2018-2024 (TCJA) | $10,000 | $5,000 |
| **2025** | **$40,000** | **$20,000** |
| **2026-2029** | **$40,000+ (indexed to inflation)** | **$20,000+ (indexed)** |
| **2030 and after** | **$10,000 (reset)** | **$5,000 (reset)** |

- **Key change:** The cap increases from $10,000 to $40,000 for most taxpayers beginning in 2025.
- **MFS parity:** Married filing separately taxpayers get $20,000 each (previously $5,000 each), eliminating the marriage penalty for SALT deductions.
- **Income phase-out:** The $40,000 SALT cap is reduced for taxpayers with AGI exceeding certain thresholds (the cap phases down for very high-income taxpayers).
- **Sunset:** The cap reverts to $10,000/$5,000 beginning in tax year 2030 under current law.
- **Pass-through entity (PTE) workaround:** State-level PTE tax elections continue to be available as an alternative to the individual SALT cap.

---

## 4. Tax Bracket Adjustments

The OBBBA makes the TCJA's seven tax brackets permanent:

| Rate | Single | MFJ | HOH |
|------|--------|-----|-----|
| 10% | $0 - $11,925 | $0 - $23,850 | $0 - $17,000 |
| 12% | $11,926 - $48,475 | $23,851 - $96,950 | $17,001 - $64,850 |
| 22% | $48,476 - $103,350 | $96,951 - $206,700 | $64,851 - $103,350 |
| 24% | $103,351 - $197,300 | $206,701 - $394,600 | $103,351 - $197,300 |
| 32% | $197,301 - $250,525 | $394,601 - $501,050 | $197,301 - $250,500 |
| 35% | $250,526 - $626,350 | $501,051 - $751,600 | $250,501 - $626,350 |
| 37% | Over $626,350 | Over $751,600 | Over $626,350 |

*Note: These are approximate 2025 amounts. For 2026, the 10% and 12% brackets receive an additional inflation adjustment, expanding the amount of income taxed at those lower rates.*

All bracket thresholds are **indexed to inflation** annually using the Chained Consumer Price Index (C-CPI-U).

---

## 5. Section 179 Expensing Increase

The OBBBA substantially increases the Section 179 deduction limits:

| Item | Prior Law (2025) | OBBBA (2025+) |
|------|-----------------|---------------|
| Maximum deduction | $1,160,000 | **$2,500,000** |
| Phase-out threshold | $2,890,000 | **$4,000,000** |

- Effective for property **placed in service after December 31, 2024**.
- Both limits are **indexed to inflation** going forward.
- Applies to tangible personal property, off-the-shelf computer software, qualified improvement property, and certain other property.
- The Section 179 deduction still cannot exceed the taxpayer's aggregate taxable income from all active trades or businesses.

---

## 6. 100% Bonus Depreciation Restoration

The OBBBA reinstates and makes permanent **100% first-year bonus depreciation**:

| Tax Year | Bonus Depreciation % (Pre-OBBBA) | Bonus Depreciation % (OBBBA) |
|----------|----------------------------------|------------------------------|
| 2022 | 100% | 100% |
| 2023 | 80% | 100% (retroactive) |
| 2024 | 60% | 100% (retroactive) |
| 2025 | 40% (scheduled) | **100%** |
| 2026+ | 20% then 0% (scheduled) | **100% (permanent)** |

- Applies to **qualified property acquired and placed in service after January 19, 2025**.
- The OBBBA retroactively restores 100% bonus depreciation for property placed in service in 2023 and 2024 (taxpayers may file amended returns or adjustments).
- Includes new and used property (as under TCJA).
- **Qualified Production Property (QPP):** A new elective 100% depreciation allowance is available for qualified production property placed in service through 2030, including certain commercial/industrial real property.

---

## 7. Section 199A -- QBI Deduction Made Permanent

The OBBBA makes the **Section 199A Qualified Business Income (QBI) deduction permanent**. Key provisions:

| Item | Prior Law | OBBBA |
|------|-----------|-------|
| Deduction rate | 20% (expiring after 2025) | **20% (permanent)** |
| SSTB phase-in range (Single) | $50,000 | **$75,000** |
| SSTB phase-in range (MFJ) | $100,000 | **$175,000** |
| Sunset | December 31, 2025 | **None (permanent)** |

- The 20% deduction on qualified business income from pass-through entities (partnerships, S corporations, sole proprietorships) is now a **permanent** feature of the tax code.
- **Specified Service Trade or Business (SSTB) rules** continue to apply, but the phase-in ranges are widened, meaning more taxpayers in service businesses can claim the deduction before it phases out completely.
- QBI continues to **exclude**: guaranteed payments for services, reasonable compensation, investment income, and Section 707(a) payments.
- The deduction is still subject to the **W-2 wage and UBIA limitations** for taxpayers above the income thresholds.
- Reported to partners on Schedule K-1, Box 20, Code Z.

---

## 8. Child Tax Credit

The OBBBA modifies the Child Tax Credit:

| Item | Prior TCJA Law | OBBBA |
|------|---------------|-------|
| Maximum credit per child (2025) | $2,000 | **$2,500** |
| Maximum credit per child (2026-2028) | $2,000 (was set to revert to $1,000) | **$2,000 (permanent)** |
| Refundable portion (ACTC) | Up to $1,700 (2024) | **Up to $1,400** |
| Phase-out threshold (MFJ) | $400,000 | **$400,000 (permanent)** |
| Phase-out threshold (other) | $200,000 | **$200,000 (permanent)** |

- The credit is **$2,500 per qualifying child for 2025**, then adjusts in subsequent years.
- The $400,000/$200,000 phase-out thresholds are made permanent (they would have reverted to $110,000/$75,000).
- The refundable portion (Additional Child Tax Credit) continues with inflation adjustments.

---

## 9. Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT)

The OBBBA makes the TCJA's expanded AMT exemptions permanent:

| Item | 2025 Amount |
|------|-------------|
| AMT Exemption (Single) | $88,100 |
| AMT Exemption (MFJ) | $137,000 |
| AMT Exemption (MFS) | $68,500 |
| Phase-out threshold (Single) | $626,350 |
| Phase-out threshold (MFJ) | $1,252,700 |

- The increased exemption amounts and phase-out thresholds are **made permanent** with annual inflation indexing.
- Starting in **2026**, the AMT exemption phase-out percentage increases from **25% to 50%**, which means the exemption phases out more quickly for high-income taxpayers.
- The phase-out thresholds are reset to $500,000 (Single) and $1,000,000 (MFJ) in 2026, with inflation adjustments going forward.

---

## 10. Estate and Gift Tax Exemption

| Tax Year | Exemption Per Person |
|----------|---------------------|
| 2025 | $13,990,000 |
| **2026** | **$15,000,000** |
| 2027+ | Indexed to inflation |
