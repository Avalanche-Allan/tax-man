## Overview

Schedule 1 (Form 1040), "Additional Income and Adjustments to Income," is attached
to Form 1040 when the taxpayer has income types or adjustments not reported directly
on Form 1040 itself. The totals from Schedule 1 flow to:

- **Line 8** of Form 1040 (total additional income from Part I)
- **Line 10** of Form 1040 (total adjustments to income from Part II)

These amounts are used to calculate **Adjusted Gross Income (AGI)** on Form 1040,
Line 11.

Part I reports sources of income beyond wages, salaries, interest, dividends, IRA
distributions, pensions, and Social Security benefits (which are reported directly

## Key Lines -- Detailed Guidance

### Line 15: Deductible Part of Self-Employment Tax

**What it is:** Self-employed individuals pay both the employer and employee portions
of Social Security and Medicare taxes (self-employment tax). The IRS allows a deduction
for the **employer-equivalent portion** (50%) of the self-employment tax.

**How to calculate:**

1. Complete **Schedule SE** (Self-Employment Tax) to determine total SE tax.
2. The deductible amount is **one-half (50%)** of the total self-employment tax.
3. Enter this amount on Schedule 1, Line 15.

**Key details:**

- For 2024-2025, the self-employment tax rate is **15.3%** (12.4% Social Security +
  2.9% Medicare) on net SE earnings up to the Social Security wage base ($168,600 for
  2024; $176,100 for 2025).
- The 2.9% Medicare tax applies to **all** net SE earnings with no cap.
- Additional 0.9% Medicare tax applies to SE earnings exceeding $200,000
  (single) / $250,000 (MFJ). The additional 0.9% is **not** deductible.
- Net SE earnings for this calculation = (Schedule C net profit) x 92.35%
  (this accounts for the employer-equivalent portion).

**Impact:** This deduction reduces AGI but does **not** reduce net earnings subject
to self-employment tax. It is purely an income tax adjustment.

```
Deductible SE Tax = Schedule SE, Section A, Line 13 (or Section B equivalent)
                  = approximately 7.65% of net SE earnings (up to wage base)
                    + 1.45% of net SE earnings above wage base
```

### Line 17: Self-Employed Health Insurance Deduction

**What it is:** An above-the-line deduction for health, dental, vision, and qualifying
long-term care insurance premiums paid by self-employed individuals.

**Computed on:** Form 7206, Self-Employed Health Insurance Deduction.

**Eligibility requirements:**

1. You had a **net profit** from self-employment (Schedule C, Schedule F, or
   partnership/S corp income).
2. The insurance plan was established under your business.
3. You were **not eligible** for employer-subsidized health coverage (your own or
   spouse's employer) for any month you claim the deduction.

**Critical limitation -- Net SE Income:**

The deduction is limited to the **net profit** of the business under which the
insurance plan is established. Specifically:

```
Maximum Deduction = Net SE Income
                  - Deductible part of SE tax (Line 15 amount attributable to that business)
                  - SE retirement plan contributions (Line 16 amount for that business)
```

The deduction **cannot create or increase a business loss**.

**Interaction with self-employment tax:**
- You **cannot** deduct SE health insurance premiums when computing net earnings
  for self-employment tax. The deduction only reduces income tax, not SE tax.

**Interaction with Premium Tax Credit:**
- If you claim the Premium Tax Credit (Form 8962), the SE health insurance deduction
  and PTC must be calculated **iteratively** because each affects the other (the
  deduction reduces AGI, which may increase the PTC, which reduces the premium you
  paid, which reduces the deduction).
- See Form 7206 instructions and Publication 974 for the iterative calculation.

**Multiple businesses:**
- If you have multiple sources of SE income, allocate premiums among the businesses.
  The allocation must be reasonable and consistent.

**Long-term care premium limits (age-based, 2024):**

| Age at End of Tax Year | Maximum LTC Premium Deduction |
|------------------------|-------------------------------|
| 40 or under            | $470                          |
| 41 to 50               | $880                          |
| 51 to 60               | $1,760                        |
| 61 to 70               | $4,710                        |
| Over 70                | $5,880                        |

## How Schedule 1 Flows into Form 1040

```
Form 1040, Line 8  = Schedule 1, Line 10  (Additional income)
Form 1040, Line 9  = (Total income = Lines 1 through 7 + Line 8)
Form 1040, Line 10 = Schedule 1, Line 26  (Adjustments to income)
Form 1040, Line 11 = Line 9 - Line 10     (Adjusted Gross Income)
```

**AGI (Line 11)** is a critical figure used throughout the return to determine:
- Eligibility for credits and deductions
- Phase-outs for itemized deductions
- Premium Tax Credit eligibility
- Education credits
- Roth IRA contribution eligibility
- Net Investment Income Tax threshold
