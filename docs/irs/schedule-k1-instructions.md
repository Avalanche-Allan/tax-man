## Overview

Schedule K-1 (Form 1065) reports each partner's share of a partnership's income, deductions, credits, and other items. The partnership files Form 1065 and issues a K-1 to each partner. Partners then use the K-1 to report their share on their individual Form 1040 (or other applicable return).

**Important:** Do not attach Schedule K-1 to your Form 1040 unless backup withholding is reported in Box 15 (Code B).

Beginning with tax year 2024, partners receiving property distributions from the partnership must file Form 7217 (Partner's Report of Property Distributed by a Partnership) for each distribution date.

## Box 20, Code Z -- Section 199A QBI Information (Detailed)

This is one of the most important items on Schedule K-1 for individual partners. Code Z provides the information necessary to compute the **Section 199A Qualified Business Income Deduction** (up to 20% of QBI).

### What is Reported Under Code Z

The partnership will attach a **statement** (often referenced as "STMT") providing the following items for each qualified trade or business:

1. **Qualified Business Income (QBI):** The net amount of qualified items of income, gain, deduction, and loss from the partnership's trade or business. This generally includes Box 1 ordinary income but **excludes**:
   - Guaranteed payments for services (Box 4)
   - Investment/portfolio income (Boxes 5, 6, 7)
   - Capital gains/losses (Boxes 8, 9)
   - Reasonable compensation
   - Section 707(a) payments

2. **W-2 Wages:** The partner's allocable share of the partnership's total W-2 wages paid to employees. Used for the wage/capital limitation that applies to taxpayers above the income threshold.

3. **Unadjusted Basis Immediately After Acquisition (UBIA) of Qualified Property:** The original cost of tangible depreciable property held by the partnership that:
   - Was placed in service within the last 10 years, OR
   - Has a recovery period that has not yet ended.
   Used for the wage/capital limitation.

4. **Qualified REIT Dividends and Qualified PTP Income:** If the partnership holds interests in REITs or publicly traded partnerships.

5. **Section 199A Specified Service Trade or Business (SSTB) Indicator:** Whether the activity is an SSTB (e.g., health, law, accounting, consulting, athletics, financial services, brokerage). SSTBs are subject to phase-out for taxpayers with taxable income exceeding $191,950 (single) / $383,900 (MFJ) for 2025.

### How Code Z Flows to the Partner's Return

1. **Form 8995** (simplified) or **Form 8995-A** (detailed) is used to compute the Section 199A deduction.
2. The deduction equals the **lesser of**:
   - 20% of QBI from all qualified businesses, OR
   - 20% of taxable income (minus net capital gains).
3. For taxpayers **above the income threshold**, the deduction is further limited to the **greater of**:
   - 50% of W-2 wages, OR
   - 25% of W-2 wages plus 2.5% of UBIA of qualified property.
4. The Section 199A deduction is taken as a **deduction from taxable income** (not an above-the-line adjustment) -- it reduces taxable income but does not reduce AGI.
5. Under the OBBBA (signed July 4, 2025), **Section 199A has been made permanent** (it was previously set to expire after 2025).

## Partner Basis Tracking

Partners must track their **outside basis** in the partnership interest. The general ordering rules are:

| Item | Effect on Basis |
|------|----------------|
| Contributions of cash or property | Increase |
| Distributive share of income (all boxes) | Increase |
| Tax-exempt income (Box 18, Code A/B) | Increase |
| Distributions (Box 19) | Decrease |
| Distributive share of losses/deductions | Decrease |
| Nondeductible expenses (Box 18, Code C) | Decrease |

**Basis cannot go below zero.** Losses in excess of basis are suspended and carried forward.

Beginning in 2020, partnerships are required to report partner capital accounts using the **tax basis method** on Schedule K-1 (Item L).
