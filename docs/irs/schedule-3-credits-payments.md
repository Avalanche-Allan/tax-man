## Overview

Schedule 3 (Form 1040), "Additional Credits and Payments," is attached to Form 1040
when the taxpayer claims credits or has made payments beyond those reported directly on
Form 1040. It was introduced alongside Schedules 1 and 2 as part of the Tax Cuts and
Jobs Act (2017) restructuring. The totals from Schedule 3 flow to:

- **Form 1040, Line 20** -- Part I total (nonrefundable credits)
- **Form 1040, Line 31** -- Part II total (other payments and refundable credits)

Nonrefundable credits (Part I) reduce your tax liability but cannot reduce it below
zero. Refundable credits (Part II) can generate a refund even if no tax is owed.

## Part I -- Nonrefundable Credits

Part I collects credits that reduce tax liability dollar-for-dollar but cannot produce
a refund on their own. These credits are applied after the child tax credit and other
credits reported directly on Form 1040.

### Line-by-Line

| Line | Description | Notes |
|------|-------------|-------|

## Nonrefundable vs. Refundable Credits -- Key Distinction

| Type | Can reduce tax below zero? | Where totaled |
|------|---------------------------|---------------|
| **Nonrefundable** (Part I) | No -- limited to your tax liability | Form 1040, Line 20 |
| **Refundable** (Part II) | Yes -- excess generates a refund | Form 1040, Line 31 |

Credits are applied in a specific order on Form 1040:
1. Child tax credit and credit for other dependents (Line 19)
2. Schedule 3, Part I nonrefundable credits (Line 20)
3. These reduce the total tax; then payments and refundable credits (including Part II)
   determine whether you owe or receive a refund.
