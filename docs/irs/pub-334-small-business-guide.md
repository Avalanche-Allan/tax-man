## 1. Overview

Publication 334 provides federal tax guidance for small business owners who operate as
sole proprietors or statutory employees and file Schedule C (Form 1040). It covers
business structures, income, expenses, self-employment tax, estimated tax, recordkeeping,
information returns, employment taxes, and forming or dissolving a business.

---

## 2. Business Structures

### Sole Proprietorship

- The simplest business form; an unincorporated business owned by one individual.
- No separate legal entity -- business income and expenses are reported on **Schedule C (Form 1040)**.
- Owner is personally liable for all business debts and obligations.
- Subject to self-employment tax on net earnings.

### Partnership

- An unincorporated business with two or more persons carrying on a trade or business together.
- Files **Form 1065** (U.S. Return of Partnership Income) as an information return.
- Each partner receives a **Schedule K-1 (Form 1065)** showing their share of income, deductions, and credits.
- Partners report their distributive share on their individual returns and pay SE tax on guaranteed payments and distributive share of ordinary business income.

### Limited Liability Company (LLC)

- A state-law entity that provides limited liability protection to its owners (members).
- **Federal tax classification depends on elections:**
  - Single-member LLC: Treated as a disregarded entity (sole proprietorship) by default -- files Schedule C.
  - Multi-member LLC: Treated as a partnership by default -- files Form 1065.
  - LLC may elect to be treated as a corporation (Form 8832) or S corporation (Form 2553).
- The LLC structure does not create a separate federal tax classification on its own.

### S Corporation

- A corporation that elects pass-through taxation under Subchapter S by filing **Form 2553**.
- Files **Form 1120-S** (U.S. Income Tax Return for an S Corporation).
- Shareholders receive **Schedule K-1 (Form 1120-S)** showing their share of income and deductions.
- Owner-employees receive W-2 wages for services performed (subject to employment taxes).
- Distributive share of S corp income is generally **not** subject to self-employment tax (unlike a partnership).
- Must meet eligibility requirements: 100 or fewer shareholders, one class of stock, domestic corporation, eligible shareholders only.

## 3. Employer Identification Number (EIN)

An EIN is a nine-digit number assigned by the IRS for tax reporting purposes.

### When an EIN Is Required

- You have employees.
- You operate as a partnership or corporation.
- You file employment, excise, alcohol, tobacco, or firearms returns.
- You withhold taxes on income (other than wages) paid to a nonresident alien.
- You have a Keogh plan or are involved with certain trusts, estates, or nonprofits.
- You are a payer of gambling winnings.

### When an EIN Is NOT Required

A sole proprietor with no employees and none of the above conditions may use their Social Security Number (SSN) for tax reporting.

### How to Obtain an EIN

- **Online:** IRS EIN Assistant at irs.gov (immediate issuance).
- **Phone:** (800) 829-4933.
- **Fax or Mail:** Submit Form SS-4 to the IRS.

## 4. Accounting Methods

An accounting method is a set of rules for determining when to report income and expenses. The method chosen must clearly reflect income and be used consistently.

### Cash Method

- **Income** is reported in the year it is actually or constructively received.
- **Expenses** are deducted in the year they are actually paid.
- Most common method for sole proprietors and small businesses.
- Generally available to businesses with average annual gross receipts of **$30 million or less** (over the prior 3-year period) under the small business taxpayer exception.

### Accrual Method

- **Income** is reported in the year it is earned, regardless of when payment is received.
- **Expenses** are deducted in the year the liability is incurred, regardless of when payment is made.
- Required for businesses that maintain inventories (unless qualifying for the small business taxpayer exception).
- Required for C corporations and partnerships with a C corporation partner that exceed the gross receipts threshold.

### Hybrid Method

- A combination of cash and accrual methods is permitted as long as income is clearly reflected and the method is used consistently.
- Example: Accrual method for purchases and sales of inventory, cash method for all other items.

### Changing Accounting Methods

- Requires IRS consent by filing **Form 3115** (Application for Change in Accounting Method).
- Some changes qualify for automatic consent procedures.

---

## 5. Business Income

All income received in the course of operating a business is generally taxable unless specifically excluded. Report gross income on Schedule C, Part I.

### Types of Business Income

- Gross receipts from sales of goods or services
- Fees, commissions, and tips
- Returns and allowances (reduce gross receipts)
- Barter income (fair market value of goods or services received)
- Interest on business accounts or notes receivable
- Rental income from business property (if incidental to business)
- Recovered amounts previously deducted (tax benefit rule)
- Cancellation of debt income (unless an exception applies)
- Prizes, awards, and contest winnings related to business
- Kickbacks and illegal income

### Constructive Receipt

Income is constructively received when it is credited to your account, set apart for you, or made available to you without substantial limitations or restrictions -- even if you do not actually possess it.

---

## 6. Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)

If you manufacture or purchase goods to sell, you generally must value inventory and determine COGS to calculate gross profit. Reported on Schedule C, Part III (Lines 35-42).

### COGS Formula

```
Beginning Inventory
+ Purchases (net of returns and discounts)
+ Cost of Labor
+ Materials and Supplies
+ Other Costs
= Cost of Goods Available for Sale
- Ending Inventory
= Cost of Goods Sold
```

### Inventory Valuation Methods

- **Cost method:** Actual cost of the item (most common).
- **Lower of cost or market (LCM):** Compare each item's cost to its current market value; use the lower figure.
- **Retail method:** Approximation based on retail price less markup.

### Small Business Taxpayer Exception

Businesses with average annual gross receipts of **$30 million or less** (3-year average) are not required to account for inventories under IRC 471 and may treat inventory as non-incidental materials and supplies (deductible when used or consumed) or conform to their financial accounting treatment.

---

## 7. Business Expenses Overview

Business expenses are the costs of carrying on a trade or business. They are deductible if both **ordinary** (common and accepted) and **necessary** (helpful and appropriate).

### Capital vs. Current Expenses

- **Capital expenses:** Costs that provide a lasting benefit beyond the current year -- must be capitalized and recovered through depreciation, amortization, or depletion.

> **Reference:** See Publication 535 for detailed guidance on specific business expenses.

## 8. Self-Employment Tax

### Overview

Self-employment (SE) tax consists of Social Security and Medicare taxes for individuals who work for themselves. It is the self-employed equivalent of FICA taxes withheld from employees.

### SE Tax Rate: 15.3%

| Component | Rate | 2025 Wage Base |
|-----------|------|---------------|
| Social Security | 12.4% | $176,100 |
| Medicare | 2.9% | No limit |
| **Total** | **15.3%** | -- |

**Additional Medicare Tax:** An extra **0.9%** Medicare tax applies to SE earnings exceeding **$200,000** ($250,000 MFJ, $125,000 MFS).

### Minimum Threshold: $400

You must file **Schedule SE** and pay SE tax if net earnings from self-employment are **$400 or more** during the tax year. (Exception: church employees must file if earnings are $108.28 or more.)

### The 92.35% Factor

SE tax is not calculated on 100% of net self-employment earnings. Instead, net earnings are multiplied by **92.35% (0.9235)** to arrive at the taxable base. This factor mirrors the employer-equivalent portion of FICA that would be excluded from an employee's wages.

### Calculation

```
1. Net profit from Schedule C (or Schedule K-1)
2. Multiply by 92.35% (0.9235) = Net earnings subject to SE tax
3. Apply 15.3% rate (12.4% SS up to wage base + 2.9% Medicare on all)
4. Result = Total SE tax (Schedule SE, line 12)
```

### Deduction for Employer-Equivalent Portion

The taxpayer may deduct **50% of SE tax** as an above-the-line adjustment on Schedule 1, line 15. This deduction reduces AGI but does **not** reduce net earnings subject to SE tax.

### Reporting

- **Schedule SE (Form 1040):** Computes the SE tax.
- SE tax is added to income tax on Form 1040, Schedule 2, line 4.

---

## 9. Estimated Tax

Self-employed individuals generally must make quarterly estimated tax payments if they expect to owe **$1,000 or more** in tax for the year after subtracting withholding and refundable credits.

### Due Dates (2025)

| Quarter | Period Covered | Due Date |
|---------|---------------|----------|
| Q1 | Jan 1 -- Mar 31 | April 15, 2025 |
| Q2 | Apr 1 -- May 31 | June 16, 2025 |
| Q3 | Jun 1 -- Aug 31 | September 15, 2025 |
| Q4 | Sep 1 -- Dec 31 | January 15, 2026 |

### Safe Harbor Rules

To avoid an underpayment penalty, the taxpayer must pay at least:

- **90%** of the current year's tax liability, or
- **100%** of the prior year's tax liability (110% if prior-year AGI exceeds $150,000; $75,000 MFS).

### Payment Methods

- **Form 1040-ES** (voucher with check or money order)
- **IRS Direct Pay** (irs.gov)
- **Electronic Federal Tax Payment System (EFTPS)**
- **Credit or debit card** via approved payment processors

> **Reference:** See Publication 505 for detailed estimated tax guidance.

- Misclassification may result in liability for unpaid employment taxes, penalties, and interest.
- Use **Form SS-8** to request an IRS determination on worker status.
