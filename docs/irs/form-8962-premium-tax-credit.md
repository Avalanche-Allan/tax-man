## Overview

**Form 8962, Premium Tax Credit (PTC)**, is used to:

1. **Claim** the Premium Tax Credit if you enrolled in a qualified health plan through the **Health Insurance Marketplace** (also called the Exchange) and did not receive advance payments
2. **Reconcile** Advance Premium Tax Credit (APTC) payments that were paid directly to your insurance company on your behalf during the year

The Premium Tax Credit is a **refundable credit** created by the Affordable Care Act (ACA) to help eligible individuals and families afford health insurance purchased through the Marketplace. For 2025, enhanced PTC provisions continue under the One, Big, Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA), which extended the enhanced credits originally established by the American Rescue Plan Act.

---

## Who Must File Form 8962

You **must** file Form 8962 if:

- **APTC was paid** on your behalf (you will have received Form 1095-A from the Marketplace)
- You want to **claim the PTC** (even if no advance payments were made)
- You enrolled in Marketplace coverage and received Form 1095-A

You must attach Form 8962 to your tax return (Form 1040, 1040-SR, or 1040-NR).

**If APTC was paid and you do not file Form 8962:** The IRS may reduce your refund or assess additional tax because excess APTC cannot be reconciled without the form.

---

## Eligibility Requirements

To be an **applicable taxpayer** eligible for the PTC, you must meet ALL of the following:

### Income Requirements

- **Household income** must be at or above **100% of the Federal Poverty Level (FPL)** for your family size
- For 2025, there is **no upper income limit** for PTC eligibility under the enhanced credit provisions (the credit phases out but does not have a hard cutoff at 400% FPL)
- If household income is below 100% FPL, you generally cannot claim PTC (exception: if you were approved for APTC based on projected income at or above 100% FPL)

### 2025 Federal Poverty Level (Contiguous 48 States + DC)

| Family Size | 100% FPL | 150% FPL | 200% FPL | 250% FPL | 300% FPL | 400% FPL |
|-------------|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|
| **1** | $15,650 | $23,475 | $31,300 | $39,125 | $46,950 | $62,600 |
| **2** | $21,150 | $31,725 | $42,300 | $52,875 | $63,450 | $84,600 |
| **3** | $26,650 | $39,975 | $53,300 | $66,625 | $79,950 | $106,600 |
| **4** | $32,150 | $48,225 | $64,300 | $80,375 | $96,450 | $128,600 |

*Add $5,500 for each additional person. Alaska and Hawaii have higher FPL amounts.*

### Marketplace Coverage Requirement

- You (or a member of your tax family) must have been enrolled in a **qualified health plan** through a Marketplace for at least one month
- The plan must have been for a month in which no member of your coverage family was eligible for **minimum essential coverage** through an employer or government program (Medicaid, Medicare, CHIP, TRICARE, etc.)

### Filing Status Requirement

- You must file a tax return (even if not otherwise required)
- You generally **cannot** file as Married Filing Separately (see MFS rules below)
- You cannot be claimed as a dependent on another person's tax return

---

## Key Concepts and Definitions

### Household Income

Your **household income** for PTC purposes is the **modified adjusted gross income (MAGI)** of:

- You and your spouse (if filing jointly), PLUS
- Each dependent required to file a tax return (whose income exceeds the filing threshold)

MAGI for PTC purposes = AGI + tax-exempt interest + tax-exempt Social Security benefits + excluded foreign earned income.

### Coverage Family

The individuals in your tax family enrolled in a Marketplace plan. This may be a subset of your tax family (e.g., if some family members have employer coverage and others have Marketplace coverage).

### Tax Family

You, your spouse (if filing jointly), and your tax dependents.

### Benchmark Plan (SLCSP)

The **Second Lowest Cost Silver Plan (SLCSP)** is the benchmark plan used to calculate the PTC. This is the second cheapest silver-level plan available through the Marketplace in your area that covers your coverage family.

- The SLCSP premium is reported on **Form 1095-A, Column B** (for each month)
- The PTC is based on the difference between the SLCSP premium and your expected contribution
- You do NOT need to be enrolled in the SLCSP to receive the PTC -- the credit is calculated using the SLCSP premium regardless of which plan you actually chose

---

## Computing the Premium Tax Credit

The PTC is calculated on a **monthly** basis. For each month:

```
Monthly PTC = Monthly SLCSP Premium - Monthly Expected Contribution
```

But the PTC cannot exceed the **monthly enrollment premium** (what you actually pay for the plan you chose).

### Step-by-Step Calculation

1. **Determine household income** as a percentage of FPL (Form 8962, Line 5)
2. **Look up the applicable figure** (expected contribution percentage) from Table 2 based on your income/FPL percentage (Form 8962, Line 7)
3. **Calculate annual contribution amount:** Household Income x Applicable Figure (Form 8962, Line 8a)
4. **Calculate monthly contribution amount:** Annual Contribution / 12 (Form 8962, Line 8b)
5. **For each month**, the PTC is the lesser of:
   - Monthly SLCSP premium (Column B of Form 1095-A) minus monthly contribution amount, OR
   - Monthly enrollment premium (Column A of Form 1095-A)
6. **Annual PTC** is the sum of all monthly PTC amounts

---

## Expected Contribution Percentages (Table 2)

The **applicable figure** determines what percentage of household income you are expected to contribute toward the benchmark plan premium. For 2025, under the enhanced credit provisions:

| Household Income as % of FPL | Initial % | Final % |
|------------------------------|-----------|---------|
| **Less than 150%** | 0.00% | 0.00% |
| **At least 150%, less than 200%** | 0.00% | 2.00% |
| **At least 200%, less than 250%** | 2.00% | 4.00% |
| **At least 250%, less than 300%** | 4.00% | 6.00% |
| **At least 300%, less than 400%** | 6.00% | 8.50% |
| **400% and above** | 8.50% | 8.50% |

### How to Read the Table

- The **initial percentage** applies at the lower bound of the income range
- The **final percentage** applies just below the upper bound
- For income within a range, the applicable figure is interpolated linearly between the initial and final percentages
- The applicable figure is then multiplied by household income to get the expected annual contribution

### Key Point for 2025

Under the enhanced provisions, the maximum contribution is capped at **8.5% of household income** for all income levels. Individuals below 150% FPL are expected to contribute **$0** (the full SLCSP premium is subsidized). These enhanced credits are set to change for tax year 2026.

## Form 1095-A and Monthly Data

### What Is Form 1095-A?

The **Health Insurance Marketplace Statement (Form 1095-A)** is sent by the Marketplace to each enrollee by **January 31** of the year following coverage. It contains the monthly data needed to complete Form 8962.

### Form 1095-A Columns

| Column | Content |
|--------|---------|
| **Column A** | Monthly enrollment premium (what you would pay for your plan at full price) |
| **Column B** | Monthly SLCSP premium (benchmark plan premium for your coverage family) |
| **Column C** | Monthly APTC amount (advance credit paid to insurer on your behalf) |

### Important Notes

- If you had coverage for fewer than 12 months, only the months with coverage will have amounts
- If SLCSP information (Column B) is missing or incorrect, use the tax tool at HealthCare.gov to determine the correct SLCSP premium
- If you had multiple 1095-A forms (e.g., changed plans mid-year, multiple family members on different policies), you must use the data from all forms

---

## Reconciling Advance Payments (APTC)

If APTC was paid on your behalf during 2025, you **must reconcile** it with the actual PTC you are entitled to.

### The Reconciliation

```
If PTC > APTC:  You get additional credit (refund or reduced tax)
If PTC < APTC:  You have excess APTC that must be repaid (subject to caps)
If PTC = APTC:  No adjustment needed
```

### Where It Appears on the Return

- **Form 8962, Line 24:** Total PTC (your actual credit for the year)
- **Form 8962, Line 25:** Total APTC (advance payments made on your behalf)
- **Form 8962, Line 26:** Net PTC (if Line 24 > Line 25) -- this is a credit, flows to Schedule 3, Line 9
- **Form 8962, Line 27:** Excess APTC (if Line 25 > Line 24) -- this is tax owed, flows to Schedule 2, Line 2, then to Form 1040, Line 17 (after applying repayment cap)
- **Form 8962, Line 29:** Excess APTC repayment (after applying limitation from Table 5)

---

## Excess APTC Repayment and Caps

If your actual PTC is less than the APTC paid on your behalf, you must repay the excess. However, for 2025, **repayment caps** limit the amount you must repay if your household income is below 400% FPL.

### Repayment Limitation Table (Table 5) -- 2025

| Household Income as % of FPL | Single Filers | All Other Filing Statuses |
|------------------------------|---------------|--------------------------|
| **Less than 200%** | $375 | $750 |
| **At least 200%, less than 300%** | $975 | $1,950 |
| **At least 300%, less than 400%** | $1,625 | $3,250 |
| **400% or more** | **No cap** (repay full excess) | **No cap** (repay full excess) |

### How the Cap Works

- If excess APTC is **less than** the applicable cap, you repay the actual excess amount
- If excess APTC is **greater than** the applicable cap, you repay only the cap amount (the remainder is forgiven)
- "Single filers" means unmarried individuals filing single or head of household
- "All other filing statuses" includes married filing jointly, qualifying surviving spouse

### Important: Repayment Caps Expire After 2025

For APTC paid during plan years beginning after December 31, 2025, the repayment limitation caps are **eliminated**. Starting in tax year 2026, taxpayers must repay 100% of any excess APTC regardless of income level.

### Income Below 100% FPL

If your actual household income falls below 100% FPL (even though you were approved for APTC based on projected income at or above 100% FPL), special rules apply. For 2025, if APTC was paid on your behalf, you may still be treated as an applicable taxpayer and the repayment caps apply.

---

## Net PTC (Refund)

If your actual PTC exceeds the APTC paid during the year:

- The **net PTC** (Line 26) is a refundable credit
- It flows to **Schedule 3, Line 9**, then to **Form 1040, Line 31**
- It reduces your tax or increases your refund
- There is **no cap** on the amount of net PTC you can receive

---

## Married Filing Separately Rules

### General Rule: MFS Cannot Claim PTC

If you file as **Married Filing Separately (MFS)**, you are generally **not** an applicable taxpayer and **cannot** claim the Premium Tax Credit.

### Exception: Domestic Abuse or Spousal Abandonment

You **may** file MFS and still claim the PTC if you certify on Form 8962 that you are a **victim of domestic abuse or spousal abandonment**. All of the following must apply:

1. You are **living apart** from your spouse at the time you file your 2025 tax return
2. You are unable to file a joint return because you are a **victim of domestic abuse** (physical, psychological, sexual, or emotional abuse) or **spousal abandonment** (your spouse left the household and you were unable to locate your spouse)
3. You check the **box on Form 8962** to certify your status

### Limitations on the Exception

- The domestic abuse / spousal abandonment exception **cannot be used for more than 3 consecutive tax years**
- If you use this exception, your household income for PTC purposes includes only YOUR income (not your absent spouse's)
- You allocate Marketplace coverage and APTC between spouses if both were enrolled

### APTC Reconciliation When MFS

If APTC was paid on your behalf and you file MFS **without** qualifying for the exception:

- You are still required to file Form 8962
- You cannot claim any PTC
- You must **repay all APTC** received (there is no repayment cap in this situation because you are not an applicable taxpayer)
- The full APTC is reported as additional tax on Schedule 2

## Alternative Calculation for Year of Marriage

If you **got married during 2025** and APTC was paid for you or your spouse before the marriage, you may be able to use the **alternative calculation for year of marriage** to reduce the amount of excess APTC you must repay.

### When to Use the Alternative Calculation

The alternative calculation is beneficial when:

- One or both spouses enrolled in Marketplace coverage as a **single individual** before the marriage
- APTC was based on the individual's income (which was lower than the combined household income after marriage)
- Filing a joint return with combined income results in excess APTC

### How It Works (Form 8962, Part V)

1. **Determine alternative start and stop months:** The months before marriage when each spouse had individual Marketplace coverage
2. **Calculate alternative family size:** Each spouse's family size before marriage (may differ from the joint family size)
3. **Calculate alternative household income:** Each spouse's individual income for the pre-marriage months
4. **Compute alternative monthly contribution amounts** for each spouse based on their pre-marriage income and FPL
5. **Compare** the standard calculation (Part II/III) with the alternative calculation (Part V)
6. Use whichever calculation results in the **lower excess APTC repayment**

### Eligibility Requirements

- You must be filing a **joint return** (MFS filers cannot use the alternative calculation)
- APTC must have been paid for at least one month before the first full calendar month of marriage
- The alternative calculation only applies to **pre-marriage months** -- post-marriage months are always calculated using the standard method

## Interaction with Self-Employed Health Insurance Deduction

If you are self-employed and purchased Marketplace coverage that is established under your business, the **PTC and self-employed health insurance deduction (Form 7206)** create a circular dependency that requires an **iterative calculation**.

### The Circular Dependency

1. The **self-employed health insurance deduction** is limited to the net premium (total premium minus PTC)
2. The deduction reduces **AGI**, which reduces **household income**
3. Lower household income changes the **expected contribution** and increases the **PTC**
4. A higher PTC reduces the net premium, which reduces the deduction
5. A lower deduction increases AGI... and the cycle repeats

### Resolving the Iterative Calculation

See **IRS Publication 974** for detailed worksheets. The general approach:

1. **Iteration 1:** Calculate the SE health insurance deduction using total premiums (no PTC adjustment). Calculate AGI, household income, and PTC.
2. **Iteration 2:** Recalculate the deduction using net premiums (total premiums minus PTC from Iteration 1). Recalculate AGI and PTC.
3. **Iteration 3+:** Repeat until the deduction and PTC amounts stabilize (typically converges within 3-5 iterations).
4. Use the **final stable amounts** as your actual deduction and PTC.

### When This Applies

- You are self-employed with a net profit
- Your health insurance is through the Marketplace
- The plan is established under your business
- You are claiming both the SE health insurance deduction AND the PTC

### When This Does NOT Apply

- Your Marketplace coverage is NOT established under your business (e.g., you have employer coverage for your business but buy individual Marketplace coverage separately)
- You are not claiming the SE health insurance deduction
- You did not receive APTC and are not claiming PTC

---

## Shared Policy Allocation

If your Marketplace policy covers individuals in **different tax families** (e.g., after a divorce, or if adult children are filing their own returns), you must allocate the enrollment premiums, SLCSP premiums, and APTC among the tax families.

### Allocation Rules

- Allocation percentages are agreed upon by the affected taxpayers (or can be split equally)
- Each taxpayer reports their share on their own Form 8962
- Allocation is done on Form 8962, Part IV (Shared Policy Allocation)
- The allocation percentages for premiums and APTC do not need to be the same, but each must total 100% across all affected taxpayers

---

## Changes in Circumstances During the Year

If your circumstances changed during the year (income, family size, coverage, address), the PTC is computed on a **month-by-month** basis to account for these changes.

### Common Mid-Year Changes

- **Income change:** Affects household income percentage of FPL for the entire year (PTC is based on annual income)
- **Marriage or divorce:** Changes filing status, family size, and household income
- **Birth or adoption:** Changes family size and coverage family
- **Move to different rating area:** Changes the applicable SLCSP premium
- **Gain or loss of employer coverage:** Affects which months are eligible for PTC
