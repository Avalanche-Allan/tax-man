Colorado Form DR 0104 is the individual income tax return for the State of Colorado. For tax year 2025, the return is filed with the Colorado Department of Revenue (CO DOR). This document covers filing requirements, the flat tax rate, additions, subtractions, credits, nonresident rules, and estimated payments.

---

## Filing Requirements

### Who Must File in Colorado

You must file a Colorado income tax return (DR 0104) if:

1. **You are required to file a federal income tax return** and you had **Colorado-source income** or were a **Colorado resident** during any part of the tax year.
2. **Full-year residents**: Must file if required to file a federal return, regardless of where the income was earned.
3. **Part-year residents**: Must file if they earned income while domiciled in Colorado or earned Colorado-source income during any part of the year.
4. **Nonresidents**: Must file if they earned income from Colorado sources (wages for work performed in CO, rental income from CO property, business income from CO operations, K-1 income attributable to CO, gains from sale of CO real property, etc.).

### Filing Thresholds (2025)

- **Single / Married Filing Separately**: Gross income of $15,700 or more (generally matches the federal standard deduction threshold).
- **Married Filing Jointly / Qualifying Surviving Spouse**: Gross income of $31,400 or more.
- **Head of Household**: Gross income of $23,500 or more.

Even if below these thresholds, you should file if you had Colorado tax withheld and want a refund, or to claim refundable credits (such as the Colorado child tax credit or TABOR sales tax refund).

### Filing Deadline

The Colorado filing deadline is **April 15, 2026** for tax year 2025, the same as the federal deadline. Colorado grants an **automatic six-month extension** to file (through October 15, 2026), but you must pay at least **90% of your net tax liability** by April 15 to avoid penalties and interest.

---

## Tax Rate

Colorado imposes a **flat income tax rate of 4.40%** for tax year 2025. This rate applies to all Colorado taxable income regardless of filing status or income level. (For reference, the rate was 4.25% for tax year 2024 due to a temporary TABOR-related reduction.)

The tax is computed as:

```
Colorado Tax = Colorado Taxable Income x 4.40%
```

---

## Starting Point: Federal Taxable Income

Colorado taxable income begins with **federal taxable income** from **Form 1040, Line 15** (or Form 1040-SR, Line 15). This is the amount after the federal standard deduction or itemized deductions and any qualified business income (QBI) deduction have been applied.

From this starting point, Colorado applies **additions** (to add back items exempt federally but taxable in CO) and **subtractions** (to remove items taxable federally but exempt in CO) to arrive at Colorado taxable income.

```
Form 104 Structure:
  Line 1:  Federal Taxable Income (Form 1040, Line 15)
  Line 2:  State income tax addback (if itemizing)
  Line 3:  Other additions (from DR 0104AD, Part I)
  Line 4:  Total additions (Line 2 + Line 3)
  Line 5:  Subtotal (Line 1 + Line 4)
  Line 6:  Subtractions from DR 0104AD (Part II)
  Line 7:  Colorado taxable income (Line 5 - Line 6)
  Line 8:  Tax (Line 7 x 4.40%)
  ...      Credits, payments, use tax, TABOR refund
```

---

## Colorado Additions (Line 4)

Additions increase Colorado taxable income above federal taxable income. Common additions reported on Form 104 and DR 0104AD Part I include:

### Line 2: State Income Tax Deduction Addback (Itemizers)

If you claimed **itemized deductions** on your federal return (Schedule A) and your total itemized deductions on Form 1040 Line 12e exceed $12,000, you must add back the excess. The calculation:

```
Addback = (Form 1040, Line 12e) - $12,000
```

This amount is then **reduced** by any state/local income tax deduction from Schedule A that is already included in Line 12e (since that state tax deduction is specifically added back). The purpose is to recapture the federal benefit of itemized deductions exceeding the standard amount.

**Note**: If you claimed the standard deduction federally, no addback is required on Line 2.

### State and Local Bond Interest from Other States

Interest on bonds issued by **states other than Colorado** (or their political subdivisions) is generally exempt from federal income tax but is **taxable in Colorado**. You must add this interest to your Colorado return. Interest on bonds issued by the State of Colorado or its political subdivisions remains exempt from Colorado tax.

### 529 Plan Non-Qualified Withdrawals

If you previously claimed a Colorado subtraction for contributions to a **CollegeInvest 529 plan** and then made a **non-qualified withdrawal** (a distribution not used for qualified higher education expenses, or used for K-12 tuition or student loan repayment), you must add back the previously subtracted amount. Non-qualifying distributions include:

- Withdrawals not used for qualified higher education expenses
- Distributions used for K-12 tuition expenses
- Distributions used for education loan repayments
- Rollovers to non-Colorado 529 plans

### Other Additions (DR 0104AD, Part I)

Additional items that may need to be added back include:

- **Non-Colorado ABLE account withdrawals** used for non-qualifying purposes
- **Addback of prior-year subtractions** if the underlying qualifying event is later reversed
- **Partnership/S corp pass-through SALT addback** amounts
- **Fiduciary adjustment additions** from estates or trusts
- Any other items specifically required by Colorado statute

---

## Colorado Subtractions (Line 7)

Subtractions reduce Colorado taxable income below federal taxable income. These are reported on **DR 0104AD** (Subtractions from Income Schedule) and carried to Form 104, Line 6. Key subtractions include:

### U.S. Government Bond Interest (DR 0104AD, Line 1)

Interest earned on **obligations of the United States government** is taxable federally but **exempt from Colorado income tax**. This includes:

- U.S. Treasury bonds, bills, and notes
- U.S. savings bonds (Series EE, Series I, Series HH)
- Other obligations of the U.S. or its territories, possessions, and agencies

**Does NOT include**: Interest from Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae), Government National Mortgage Association (Ginnie Mae), Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac), or other government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) that are not direct obligations of the U.S. government.

### State Income Tax Refund (DR 0104AD, Line 1)

If you received a **state income tax refund** in 2025 that was included in your federal gross income (because you itemized deductions in the prior year), you may subtract this amount on your Colorado return since Colorado does not tax refunds of its own income tax.

### Pension and Annuity Subtraction (DR 0104AD, Line 3)

Colorado allows a subtraction for qualifying **pension and annuity income** that is included in federal taxable income. The subtraction amounts for 2025 are:

| Age (as of December 31, 2025) | Maximum Subtraction |
|-------------------------------|-------------------|
| Under 55                      | $0 (not eligible) |
| 55 through 64                 | **$20,000**       |
| 65 or older                   | **$24,000**       |

**Qualifying income includes**:
- Social Security benefits (taxable portion)
- Pension and annuity distributions
- IRA distributions
- Distributions from 401(k), 403(b), and other qualified retirement plans

**PERA/DPS Pension**: Benefits from the Colorado Public Employees Retirement Association (PERA) and Denver Public Schools Retirement System (DPSRS) qualify for this subtraction to the extent they are included in federal taxable income. Additionally, a separate subtraction line exists for PERA contributions made during 1984-1986 and DPSRS contributions made in 1986 (which were previously taxed at the state level).

For **joint filers**, each spouse computes the subtraction separately based on their own age and their own qualifying pension/annuity income. Each spouse gets their own $20,000 or $24,000 limit.

### Military Pension/Retirement Pay Exclusion

**Military retirement pay** included in federal taxable income qualifies for the pension subtraction described above (using the same $20,000/$24,000 limits based on age). For taxpayers under age 55, Colorado also provides a subtraction for military retirement benefits under a separate provision. Active-duty military pay earned while stationed outside Colorado may also be subtracted.

### Charitable Contribution Subtraction (DR 0104AD)

Taxpayers who claim the **federal standard deduction** (and therefore do not deduct charitable contributions on Schedule A) may subtract qualifying charitable contributions on their Colorado return. The subtraction is limited to **$500** (or **$1,000** for joint filers) for cash contributions to qualifying 501(c)(3) organizations.

### CollegeInvest 529 Plan Contribution Subtraction

Contributions to a **Colorado CollegeInvest 529** savings plan may be subtracted from Colorado taxable income. For 2025, the per-beneficiary contribution subtraction limits are:

- **Single / Head of Household / MFS**: $25,400 per beneficiary
- **Married Filing Jointly**: $38,100 per beneficiary

### Wildfire Mitigation Measures (DR 0104AD)

Homeowners who incur costs for **wildfire mitigation** on their primary residence or surrounding property may subtract **50% of qualifying expenses**, up to a maximum subtraction of **$2,500 per year**. Qualifying expenses include:

- Defensible space creation (tree thinning, brush removal)
- Fuel reduction measures
- Fire-resistant landscaping
- Other mitigation measures as defined by the Colorado State Forest Service

### Other Subtractions (DR 0104AD, Part II)

Additional subtractions that may apply:

- **Colorado ABLE account contributions** (for disability savings)
- **Qualified reservation income** for tribal members
- **Railroad retirement benefits** (Tier I and Tier II)
- **Colorado marijuana/natural medicine business deductions** (amounts disallowed federally under IRC 280E)
- **Non-resident disaster relief worker income** earned in CO during a declared disaster
- **Reacquisition of Colorado residency during active duty** military service
- **Qualifying capital gains** on assets held 5+ years (acquired on or after May 9, 1994), up to $100,000 per year
- **Agricultural income** and net operating loss carryforward adjustments
- **Fiduciary adjustment subtractions** from estates or trusts

---

## Colorado Child Tax Credit

Colorado provides a **state-level child tax credit** in addition to the federal credit. For tax year 2025, there are two components:

### Regular Colorado Child Tax Credit

- **Eligibility**: Children **under age 6** at the end of the tax year
- **Income limit**: Federal AGI of $77,000 or less ($87,000 for joint filers)
- **Refundable**: Yes, the credit is refundable

### Family Affordability Tax Credit

For tax years 2024 and 2025, Colorado provides an additional **Family Affordability Tax Credit**:

- **Eligibility**: Children **under age 17** at the end of the tax year
- **Income limit**: Federal AGI of $85,000 or less ($95,000 for joint filers)
- **Credit amounts (2025)**:
  - Up to **$3,273 per child under age 6**
  - Up to **$2,455 per child ages 6 through 16**
  - Credit phases down at higher income levels (e.g., $123/$92 per child for single filers with AGI between $80,000 and $85,000)
- **Refundable**: Yes

### Forms Required

To claim Colorado child tax credits, file:
- **DR 0104** (Individual Income Tax Return)
- **DR 0104CR** (Individual Credit Schedule)
- **DR 0104CN** (Colorado Child Tax Credit)

## TABOR Refund Mechanism

### What Is TABOR?

The **Taxpayer's Bill of Rights (TABOR)**, approved by Colorado voters in 1992 (Article X, Section 20 of the Colorado Constitution), limits the amount of revenue the state can retain year over year. When actual state revenue exceeds the TABOR cap, the excess must be **refunded to taxpayers**.

### How the Refund Works

TABOR refunds are delivered through multiple mechanisms:

1. **Temporary Income Tax Rate Reduction**: When TABOR is triggered, the income tax rate may be temporarily reduced (e.g., the 2024 rate was reduced from 4.40% to 4.25%). For 2025, the rate is 4.40%.

2. **Sales Tax Refund**: Despite the name, this refund is claimed on the **Colorado income tax return (DR 0104)**. It is a per-taxpayer refund of excess sales tax revenue. The refund varies by **AGI tier** (six tiers). For the refund claimed on the 2024 return (filed in 2025), the tiers and amounts for single filers were approximately:

   | Federal AGI             | Single Refund |
   |------------------------|---------------|
   | Up to $53,000          | $177          |
   | $53,001 -- $105,000    | $240          |
   | $105,001 -- $166,000   | $277          |
   | $166,001 -- $233,000   | $323          |
   | $233,001 -- $302,000   | $350          |
   | Over $302,000          | $565          |

   Joint filers receive **double** the single-filer amount.

3. **Claiming the Refund**: The sales tax refund is claimed on Form 104 and is combined with any income tax refund. Only **full-year Colorado residents** are eligible for the sales tax refund. An individual may claim the refund by filing an income tax return or a specified assistance grant application by **October 15** of the year following the tax year.

### Important Notes

- TABOR refunds for a given fiscal year are issued the **following** tax year. FY 2024 excess revenue is refunded on 2024 returns filed in 2025.
- The TABOR refund itself is **not taxable** for Colorado income tax purposes.
- Nonresidents and part-year residents are **not eligible** for the sales tax refund.

---

## Nonresident and Part-Year Resident Rules

### Form 104PN

Nonresidents and part-year residents must file **Form 104PN** (Part-Year Resident/Nonresident Tax Calculation Schedule) in addition to Form 104. Form 104PN apportions income so that Colorado tax is calculated only on Colorado-source income.

### Income Apportionment

Form 104PN uses two columns:

- **Column A (Federal)**: Modified federal adjusted gross income (all income from all sources)
- **Column B (Colorado)**: Modified Colorado adjusted gross income (only Colorado-source income)

The **apportionment percentage** is:

```
Apportionment % = Column B (Colorado Income) / Column A (Federal Income)
```

This percentage is applied to the Colorado tax computed on total income to determine the actual tax owed to Colorado.

### Colorado-Source Income

For nonresidents, the following income is considered **Colorado-source** and must be reported in Column B:

- **Wages and salaries** for services performed in Colorado (including remote work if the employer is in CO, subject to specific sourcing rules)
- **Business income** from a trade, business, profession, or occupation carried on in Colorado
- **Rental income** from real property located in Colorado
- **Gain on sale of Colorado real property**
- **Partnership/S corporation income** attributable to Colorado (per Colorado K-1)
- **Gambling winnings** from Colorado sources
- **Income from intangible property** employed in a business carried on in Colorado

### K-1 Income Sourced to Colorado

When a nonresident is a partner in a partnership or shareholder in an S corporation that does business in Colorado:

1. The **partnership/S corp files Colorado Form DR 0106** and issues a **Colorado K-1 (DR 0106K)** to each partner/shareholder.
2. The Colorado K-1 has two columns:
   - **Column A**: Partner's total share of each income/deduction item
   - **Column B**: Partner's share **attributable to Colorado**
3. The Colorado-source portion is determined based on the **partnership's Colorado apportionment factor**:
   - Partnerships doing business **only in Colorado** source 100% of income to Colorado.
   - Partnerships doing business **both within and outside Colorado** apportion income using the **receipts factor** (single-factor apportionment based on Colorado receipts / total receipts everywhere).
   - **Non-apportionable income** (e.g., gains from sale of real property, rental income from specific locations) is **directly allocated** to the state where the property or activity is located. At the partnership's election, non-apportionable income may instead be treated as apportionable income subject to the receipts factor.
4. Each item of income, gain, loss, and deduction is **sourced separately** to determine whether it is derived from Colorado sources.
5. Colorado-source income is determined under **C.R.S. 39-22-109** and **Rule 39-22-109**, or at the partnership's election, apportioned under **C.R.S. 39-22-303.6**.

### Rental Property in Colorado

Nonresidents who own rental property in Colorado must report **all rental income and expenses** from that property as Colorado-source income on Form 104PN. This includes:

- Gross rental receipts from the Colorado property
- Depreciation, mortgage interest, property taxes, insurance, and other deductions allocable to the property
- Net gain or loss on the sale or disposition of Colorado real property

If rental property is held through a partnership or LLC taxed as a partnership, the Colorado K-1 (DR 0106K) will report the partner's share of Colorado-source rental income.

### Part-Year Residents

Part-year residents report in Column B:
- **All income** earned while domiciled in Colorado (regardless of source)
- **Colorado-source income** earned while domiciled outside Colorado

### SALT Parity Act Exception

A nonresident individual partner or shareholder whose **only** Colorado-source income comes from a partnership or S corporation that has made the **SALT Parity Act election** (electing to pay Colorado income tax at the entity level) is **not required to file** a Colorado individual return.

---

## Estimated Payments (Form 104EP)

### When Estimated Payments Are Required

You must make estimated tax payments if you expect to owe **$1,000 or more** in net Colorado tax for 2025 after subtracting withholding and credits.

### Quarterly Due Dates (Tax Year 2025)

| Quarter | Due Date           |
|---------|-------------------|
| Q1      | April 15, 2025    |
| Q2      | June 15, 2025     |
| Q3      | September 15, 2025|
| Q4      | January 15, 2026  |

If a due date falls on a weekend or legal holiday, the payment is due the next business day.

### Payment Methods

- **Online**: Colorado.gov/RevenueOnline (recommended)
- **By mail**: Use Form DR 0104EP with payment

### Safe Harbor

To avoid an estimated tax penalty, pay at least:
- **100% of the prior year's tax liability**, or
- **70% of the current year's net tax liability**

through a combination of withholding and estimated payments by the required due dates.

---

## Use of Colorado-Sourced Income for Nonresidents

Colorado taxes nonresidents **only** on income derived from Colorado sources. The key principle is that Colorado cannot tax a nonresident's income earned entirely outside the state. However, the **tax rate** applied to Colorado-source income is effectively the rate that would apply to the taxpayer's **total** income. This is accomplished through the apportionment mechanism on Form 104PN:

1. Compute Colorado tax on **total** taxable income (as if a full-year resident).
2. Multiply by the **apportionment percentage** (Colorado income / total income).
3. The result is the tax attributable to Colorado-source income.

This method ensures that higher-income nonresidents pay at the same effective rate on their Colorado income, even though Colorado uses a flat rate. The practical effect is that the flat 4.40% rate applies equally, but the apportionment percentage determines how much of total income is subject to Colorado tax.

### Credits for Taxes Paid to Other States

- **Colorado residents** who pay income tax to another state on income also taxed by Colorado may claim a **credit for taxes paid to other states** on Form 104CR to avoid double taxation.
- **Nonresidents** generally do not claim this credit on their Colorado return; instead, they claim a credit on their **home state** return for taxes paid to Colorado.
