# Schedule SE Instructions (2025)
Source: https://www.irs.gov/instructions/i1040sse

Self-Employment Tax -- Schedule SE (Form 1040)

Use Schedule SE (Form 1040) to figure the tax due on net earnings from self-employment. The Social Security Administration (SSA) uses the information from Schedule SE to figure your benefits under the social security program. Self-employment tax consists of Social Security tax and Medicare tax.

---

## Who Must File Schedule SE

You must file Schedule SE if:

1. **Net self-employment earnings of $400 or more.** You had net earnings from self-employment of $400 or more (including your share of partnership income or loss from a trade or business). If your net earnings from self-employment were less than $400, you do not need to pay SE tax.

2. **Church employee income of $108.28 or more.** You had church employee income of $108.28 or more. Church employee income is wages you received as an employee (other than as a minister, member of a religious order, or Christian Science practitioner) of a church or qualified church-controlled organization that has a certificate in effect electing an exemption from employer Social Security and Medicare taxes (Form 8274).

**Note:** Even if you had a loss or very small amount of income from self-employment, you may still want to file Schedule SE to receive credit for Social Security coverage (see Part II -- Optional Methods).

## Self-Employment Tax Rates (2025)

The self-employment tax rate is **15.3%**, broken down as follows:

| Component | Rate | Wage Base Limit (2025) |
|---|---|---|
| Social Security (OASDI) | **12.4%** | $176,100 |
| Medicare (HI) | **2.9%** | No limit |
| **Total SE Tax** | **15.3%** | -- |

- The **12.4% Social Security** portion applies only to combined wages, tips, and net SE earnings up to the annual wage base of **$176,100** for tax year 2025.
- The **2.9% Medicare** portion applies to **all** net SE earnings with no cap.
- The 15.3% rate reflects both the "employee" and "employer" shares of FICA (an employed person pays 7.65%, and their employer matches at 7.65%; a self-employed person pays the combined 15.3%).

### Additional Medicare Tax

An additional 0.9% Medicare tax applies to self-employment income exceeding the following thresholds:

| Filing Status | Threshold |
|---|---|
| Single | $200,000 |
| Married Filing Jointly | $250,000 |
| Married Filing Separately | $125,000 |

The Additional Medicare Tax is calculated on Form 8959 and reported on Schedule 2, not directly on Schedule SE. Self-employment income from Schedule SE, Part I, line 6 is used in the Form 8959 calculation.

## Definition of Net Earnings from Self-Employment

Net earnings from self-employment generally include:

- **Net profit (or loss) from a nonfarm business** you operated as a sole proprietor (Schedule C, line 31) or as an independent contractor.
- **Net profit (or loss) from farming** (Schedule F, line 34).
- **Your distributive share of partnership income (or loss)** from a trade or business, as reported on Schedule K-1 (Form 1065), box 14, code A. General partners include their distributive share of income or loss.
- **Guaranteed payments** received for services to the partnership are included.

### Exclusions

The following are generally **not** included in net earnings from self-employment:

- Limited partner income (except guaranteed payments for services rendered to the partnership).
- Rental income from real estate (unless you are a real estate dealer).
- Interest and dividend income (unless received in the course of a trade or business).
- Capital gains and losses.
- Income received by a retired partner under a written plan providing for lifelong periodic payments.
- Income earned by a nonresident alien from sources outside the United States.

### Multiple Businesses

If you had two or more businesses subject to SE tax, your net earnings from self-employment are the **combined** net earnings from all of your businesses. A loss in one business reduces the income from another.

---

## Part I -- Self-Employment Tax (Line-by-Line Instructions)

### Line 1a -- Net Farm Profit or (Loss)

Enter your net farm profit or (loss) from:
- Schedule F (Form 1040), line 34; **and**
- Farm partnerships, Schedule K-1 (Form 1065), box 14, code A.

**Note:** Skip lines 1a and 1b if you use the farm optional method in Part II (see below).

### Line 1b -- Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) Payments

If you are receiving Social Security retirement or disability benefits, enter the amount of Conservation Reserve Program payments included on Schedule F, line 4b, or listed on Schedule K-1 (Form 1065), box 20, code AH.

These CRP payments are included in net earnings from self-employment for SE tax purposes, even for individuals receiving Social Security benefits.

### Line 2 -- Net Profit or (Loss) from Nonfarm Business

Enter your net profit or (loss) from:
- Schedule C (Form 1040), line 31;
- Schedule K-1 (Form 1065), box 14, code A (nonfarm partnership income);
- Any other SE income from services you performed as a self-employed person.

**Note:** Skip line 2 if you use the nonfarm optional method in Part II (see below).

### Line 3 -- Combined Net Earnings

**Combine lines 1a, 1b, and 2.** This is your total net earnings (or loss) from self-employment before the 92.35% adjustment.

### Line 4a -- 92.35% Adjustment

**If line 3 is more than zero, multiply line 3 by 92.35% (0.9235).**

**Why 92.35%?** This factor exists because employees do not pay FICA taxes on the employer's share of FICA. To put self-employed individuals on equal footing, the IRS allows you to reduce your net SE earnings by the equivalent of the employer's share. The calculation is: 100% - 7.65% = 92.35%. This effectively simulates the deduction that employees receive because their employer's share of FICA is not treated as taxable wages.

### Line 4b -- Optional Methods Amount

If you elected to use the farm optional method, nonfarm optional method, or both (from Part II), enter the result from Part II here.

If you did not use any optional methods, skip line 4b.

### Line 4c -- Combine Lines 4a and 4b

Add lines 4a and 4b. This is your adjusted net SE earnings.

**Important:** If line 4c is less than $400 **and** you do not have church employee income of $108.28 or more, you do not owe self-employment tax. **Stop here.**

### Line 5a -- Church Employee Income

If you received wages as an employee of a church or qualified church-controlled organization that elected exemption from employer Social Security and Medicare taxes, enter the total church employee income here.

**Note:** If your **only** income subject to SE tax is church employee income, skip lines 1a through 4b, enter -0- on line 4c, and go to line 5a.

### Line 5b -- 92.35% of Church Employee Income

Multiply line 5a by 92.35% (0.9235). This applies the same employer-equivalent adjustment to church employee income.

### Line 6 -- Total Net SE Earnings for Tax Purposes

**Add lines 4c and 5b.** This is your total net earnings from self-employment subject to SE tax. This amount is also used as the basis for the Additional Medicare Tax calculation on Form 8959.

### Line 7 -- Social Security Wage Base

This line contains the maximum amount of combined wages and self-employment earnings subject to the Social Security (12.4%) portion of SE tax.

**For 2025: $176,100**

This is a fixed amount that is printed on the form. Do not change it.

### Line 8a -- Total Social Security Wages and Tips (from W-2)

Enter the total of:
- **Box 3** (Social Security wages) from all Forms W-2; **plus**
- **Box 7** (Social Security tips) from all Forms W-2; **plus**
- Railroad retirement (tier 1) compensation.

**Purpose:** This line accounts for wages from employment where Social Security tax has already been withheld. These wages count toward the $176,100 wage base, reducing the amount of SE income subject to the 12.4% Social Security tax.

### Line 8b -- Unreported Tips

Enter any unreported tips subject to Social Security tax from Form 4137 (Social Security and Medicare Tax on Unreported Tip Income), line 10.

### Line 8c -- Wages from Form 8919

Enter wages subject to Social Security tax from Form 8919 (Uncollected Social Security and Medicare Tax on Wages), line 10. This applies when an employer did not withhold Social Security and Medicare taxes from your pay and you filed Form 8919.

### Line 8d -- Total of Lines 8a + 8b + 8c

**Add lines 8a, 8b, and 8c.** This is the total amount of wages and tips already subject to Social Security tax.

### Line 9 -- Remaining Social Security Wage Base

**Subtract line 8d from line 7 ($176,100).**

- If the result is **zero or less**, enter -0-. This means your W-2 wages already exceeded the Social Security wage base, and **none** of your SE income is subject to the 12.4% Social Security tax (but your SE income is still subject to the 2.9% Medicare tax).
- If the result is **positive**, that is the remaining amount of SE earnings subject to the 12.4% Social Security tax.

**This is the key W-2 wage coordination mechanism.** If you had a W-2 job that paid $100,000 in Social Security wages, then only $76,100 ($176,100 - $100,000) of your SE income is subject to the 12.4% Social Security tax.

### Line 10 -- Social Security Tax

**Multiply the smaller of line 6 or line 9 by 12.4% (0.124).**

- Line 6 = your total net SE earnings.
- Line 9 = the remaining SS wage base after accounting for W-2 wages.
- You use the **smaller** of the two because:
  - If your SE income is less than the remaining base, you pay SS tax on all your SE income.
  - If your SE income exceeds the remaining base, you only pay SS tax up to the remaining base.

**Maximum possible Social Security tax from SE income alone (no W-2 wages):**
$176,100 x 0.124 = **$21,836.40**

### Line 11 -- Medicare Tax

**Multiply line 6 by 2.9% (0.029).**

There is **no wage base limit** for Medicare tax. All of your net SE earnings (line 6) are subject to the 2.9% Medicare tax, regardless of how much you earned from W-2 wages.

### Line 12 -- Total Self-Employment Tax

**Add lines 10 and 11.**

This is your total self-employment tax:
- Social Security tax (line 10) **+** Medicare tax (line 11) = Total SE tax.

**Enter this amount on Schedule 2 (Form 1040), line 4.**

### Line 13 -- Deductible Part of Self-Employment Tax

**Multiply line 12 by 50% (0.50).**

You can deduct **one-half** of your self-employment tax as an adjustment to income (an "above-the-line" deduction). This deduction is entered on **Schedule 1 (Form 1040), Part II, line 15.**

**Key points about this deduction:**
- This is an income tax deduction, **not** a self-employment tax deduction. It reduces your AGI and therefore your income tax, but it does not reduce the SE tax itself.
- This deduction simulates the fact that employees do not pay income tax on the employer's share of FICA.
- You get this deduction even if you do not itemize (it is taken on Schedule 1, not Schedule A).

---

## Part II -- Optional Methods

Part II contains two optional methods for calculating net earnings from self-employment. These are typically used when your SE income is very low or you had a net loss, and you want to receive Social Security coverage credit.

### Farm Optional Method

**You may use this method if:**
- Your gross farm income was not more than $10,860; **or**
- Your net farm profits were less than $7,840.

**How it works:**
- Report two-thirds (2/3) of your gross farm income as your net earnings from self-employment, up to a maximum of **$7,240**.
- Enter this amount on Part II as indicated, and carry it to line 4b.

**Limitation:** You may use this method even if your net farm profits were zero or a loss, as long as you had gross farm income.

### Nonfarm Optional Method

**You may use this method if:**
- Your net nonfarm profits were less than $7,840; **and**
- Your net nonfarm profits were less than 72.189% of your gross nonfarm income.

**How it works:**
- Report two-thirds (2/3) of your gross nonfarm income as your net earnings from self-employment, up to the applicable maximum.
- Enter this amount on Part II as indicated, and carry it to line 4b.

**Limitation:** You may use the nonfarm optional method **no more than five times** (lifetime limit). Each use counts regardless of whether it actually increased your net earnings.

### Why Use Optional Methods?

- To receive **Social Security coverage credit** even with low or zero net earnings.
- To increase **earned income** for the Earned Income Credit (EIC).
- Using an optional method may result in you paying **more** SE tax than required, but it may help you qualify for Social Security benefits or credits.

## Employees of Churches and Church Organizations

### Definition

Church employee income is wages you received as an employee (not as a minister, member of a religious order, or Christian Science practitioner) of a church or qualified church-controlled organization that has a valid certificate in effect (Form 8274) electing exemption from employer Social Security and Medicare taxes.

### How It Is Treated

- Because the church has elected exemption from employer FICA, **you** as the employee are responsible for the equivalent taxes through self-employment tax.
- No deductions for trade or business expenses are allowed against this income for SE tax purposes.
- The $108.28 threshold applies: you must pay SE tax if your church employee income is $108.28 or more for the year.

### Reporting

- Enter church employee income on **line 5a** of Schedule SE.
- Multiply by 92.35% on **line 5b**.
- This amount is combined with any other SE income on **line 6**.

## Coordination with Form 1040

Schedule SE interacts with your Form 1040 as follows:

| Schedule SE Line | Goes To | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Line 12 (Total SE Tax) | Schedule 2, line 4 | Reports total SE tax liability |
| Line 13 (Deductible Half) | Schedule 1, Part II, line 15 | Above-the-line deduction reducing AGI |
| Line 6 (Net SE Earnings) | Form 8959 | Basis for Additional Medicare Tax |

## Worked Example: Simple Self-Employment Tax Calculation

**Scenario:** A sole proprietor with $100,000 net profit from Schedule C and $50,000 in W-2 Social Security wages.

| Line | Description | Amount |
|---|---|---|
| 2 | Net profit from Schedule C | $100,000 |
| 3 | Combined net earnings (lines 1a + 1b + 2) | $100,000 |
| 4a | Line 3 x 0.9235 | $92,350 |
| 4c | Line 4a + 4b (no optional methods) | $92,350 |
| 6 | Total net SE earnings (no church income) | $92,350 |
| 7 | Social Security wage base | $176,100 |
| 8a | W-2 Social Security wages (Box 3) | $50,000 |
| 8d | Total (8a + 8b + 8c) | $50,000 |
| 9 | Line 7 minus line 8d ($176,100 - $50,000) | $126,100 |
| 10 | Smaller of line 6 ($92,350) or line 9 ($126,100) x 0.124 | $11,451.40 |
| 11 | Line 6 x 0.029 ($92,350 x 0.029) | $2,678.15 |
| 12 | Total SE tax (line 10 + line 11) | $14,129.55 |
| 13 | Deductible half (line 12 x 0.50) | $7,064.78 |

In this example:
- **$11,451.40** goes toward Social Security.
- **$2,678.15** goes toward Medicare.
- **$14,129.55** is the total SE tax (reported on Schedule 2, line 4).
- **$7,064.78** is deductible on Schedule 1, line 15, reducing AGI.

## Worked Example: W-2 Wages Exceed Social Security Base

**Scenario:** A sole proprietor with $60,000 net profit from Schedule C and $180,000 in W-2 Social Security wages.

| Line | Description | Amount |
|---|---|---|
| 2 | Net profit from Schedule C | $60,000 |
| 3 | Combined net earnings | $60,000 |
| 4a | Line 3 x 0.9235 | $55,410 |
| 4c | Adjusted net SE earnings | $55,410 |
| 6 | Total net SE earnings | $55,410 |
| 7 | Social Security wage base | $176,100 |
| 8a | W-2 Social Security wages | $176,100* |
| 8d | Total | $176,100 |
| 9 | $176,100 - $176,100 | **$0** |
| 10 | Smaller of $55,410 or $0 x 0.124 | **$0.00** |
| 11 | $55,410 x 0.029 | $1,606.89 |
| 12 | Total SE tax | $1,606.89 |
| 13 | Deductible half | $803.45 |

*Note: W-2 Box 3 is capped at the Social Security wage base by the employer, so even if your salary was $180,000, Box 3 will show $176,100.

In this example, the entire SE income is exempt from the 12.4% Social Security tax because W-2 wages already maxed out the wage base. Only the 2.9% Medicare tax applies.
