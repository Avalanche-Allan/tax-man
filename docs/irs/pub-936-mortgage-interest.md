## 1. Overview

Publication 936 explains the rules for deducting home mortgage interest on Schedule A
(Form 1040). It covers qualified residence interest, acquisition debt limits, the
treatment of home equity debt under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), points, Form 1098,
refinancing, second homes, and mixed-use/rental allocation rules.

Home mortgage interest is an **itemized deduction** reported on Schedule A, lines 8a-8c.

## 2. Qualified Residence Interest

### Definition

**Qualified residence interest** is interest paid or accrued during the tax year on
**acquisition indebtedness** secured by a **qualified residence**.

### Qualified Residence

A qualified residence is:

1. **Main home** -- The home where you ordinarily live most of the time. You can have only one main home at a time.
2. **Second home** -- One additional home you select for the tax year. You do not need to use it during the year, but if you rent it out, you must also use it as a home for more than the greater of 14 days or 10% of the days it is rented at fair rental value.

> **Note:** A home includes a house, condominium, cooperative, mobile home, house trailer, or boat that has sleeping, cooking, and toilet facilities.

### What Qualifies as Acquisition Indebtedness

Mortgage debt incurred to **buy, build, or substantially improve** a qualified residence, secured by that residence. This includes:

- Original purchase mortgage
- Construction loans (that convert to a mortgage)
- Mortgages for substantial home improvements
- Refinanced acquisition debt (up to the balance of the old mortgage -- see Section 7)

---

## 3. Acquisition Debt Limits

The maximum amount of mortgage debt on which interest is deductible depends on when the debt was incurred.

### Debt Limit Tiers

| Category | Date Range | Debt Limit (Single / MFJ / HoH / QSS) | Debt Limit (MFS) |
|----------|-----------|----------------------------------------|-------------------|
| Grandfathered debt | On or before October 13, 1987 | Unlimited (all interest deductible) | Unlimited |
| Pre-TCJA acquisition debt | After Oct 13, 1987 through Dec 15, 2017 | **$1,000,000** | **$500,000** |
| Post-TCJA acquisition debt | After December 15, 2017 | **$750,000** | **$375,000** |

### Grandfathered Debt (On or Before October 13, 1987)

- All interest on mortgage debt outstanding as of October 13, 1987 is fully deductible, regardless of the amount.
- The balance of grandfathered debt reduces the $1,000,000 or $750,000 limit available for later acquisition debt.
- Refinancing grandfathered debt retains its grandfathered status up to the balance of the old mortgage at the time of refinancing.

### Pre-TCJA Debt ($1,000,000 / $500,000 MFS)

- Mortgages taken out **after October 13, 1987 and on or before December 15, 2017** to buy, build, or substantially improve a qualified residence.
- Combined limit of **$1,000,000** ($500,000 if MFS) for all acquisition debt on the main home and second home, minus any grandfathered debt.
- This limit applies to the **combined total** of all mortgages on the main home and second home.

### Post-TCJA Debt ($750,000 / $375,000 MFS)

- Mortgages taken out **after December 15, 2017** to buy, build, or substantially improve a qualified residence.
- Combined limit of **$750,000** ($375,000 if MFS) for all acquisition debt, minus any grandfathered debt and pre-TCJA debt.
- Under the TCJA (Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017), this reduced limit applies for tax years 2018 through 2025.

### Mixed-Vintage Debt

If you have mortgages from different periods, calculate the deductible interest by applying each tier's limit. Total acquisition debt across all tiers determines the proportion of interest that is deductible:

- If total debt exceeds the applicable limit, only a proportionate share of interest is deductible.
- Use the worksheets in Publication 936 to compute the deductible amount.

### Binding Contract Exception

A taxpayer who entered into a **binding written contract before December 15, 2017** to close on the purchase of a principal residence before January 1, 2018, and who purchased the home before April 1, 2018, may use the **$1,000,000 limit** even though the mortgage was taken out after December 15, 2017.

---

## 4. Home Equity Debt (TCJA Rules)

### Pre-TCJA Rule (Tax Years Before 2018)

Before the TCJA, interest on up to $100,000 ($50,000 MFS) of home equity debt was
deductible regardless of how the proceeds were used. Home equity debt was any debt
secured by the qualified residence that was not acquisition debt.

### TCJA Rule (Tax Years 2018-2025)

Under the TCJA, for tax years 2018 through 2025, interest on home equity debt is
**not deductible** unless the loan proceeds are used to **buy, build, or substantially
improve** the qualified residence that secures the debt.

### What This Means in Practice

- **Home equity loan used for home improvement:** Interest **is deductible** as acquisition indebtedness (subject to the $750,000/$375,000 limit for post-12/15/2017 debt).
- **Home equity loan used for other purposes** (paying off credit cards, college tuition, vacation, car purchase): Interest is **not deductible** for 2018-2025.
- **HELOC used partly for home improvement, partly for other purposes:** Only the portion allocable to home improvement is deductible. The taxpayer must trace the use of funds.

### Post-2025 Sunset (Potential)

If the TCJA provisions expire after 2025 without extension, the pre-TCJA rule allowing
deduction of interest on up to $100,000 of home equity debt (regardless of use) could
be reinstated for tax year 2026 and beyond. (Note: The One Big Beautiful Bill Act
extended TCJA individual provisions through 2028 in many areas; verify current law for
years after 2025.)

## 5. Points

### Definition

**Points** (also called loan origination fees, maximum loan charges, loan discount, or
discount points) are prepaid interest charges assessed at closing. One point equals
**1% of the loan amount**.

### Full Deduction in Year of Purchase

Points paid on a mortgage to **purchase or improve your main home** are fully deductible in the year paid if **all** of the following conditions are met:

1. The mortgage is secured by your **main home** (not a second home).
2. Paying points is an **established business practice** in your area.
3. The points paid are not more than the amount **generally charged** in your area.
4. You use the **cash method** of accounting.
5. The points are not paid for items usually listed separately on the settlement statement (e.g., appraisal fees, inspection fees, property taxes, title fees, attorney fees).
6. The funds you provided at or before closing (down payment, earnest money, escrow deposits, etc.), **plus** any points the seller paid, are at least as much as the points charged. (You do not have to have paid the points directly from your own funds -- funds provided at closing can be applied.)
7. The loan is used to buy or build your main home.
8. The points are computed as a percentage of the principal amount of the mortgage.
9. The amount is clearly shown on the settlement statement (Form HUD-1, Closing Disclosure, or similar) as points.

### Points on a Second Home

Points paid on a mortgage to purchase a **second home** must be **amortized** (deducted ratably) over the life of the loan. They cannot be fully deducted in the year of payment.

### Points on a Refinance

Points paid to refinance an existing mortgage generally must be **amortized over the life of the new loan**.

**Exception:** If part of the refinanced mortgage proceeds are used for **home improvements**, the portion of points allocable to the home improvement amount may be deductible in the year paid.

### Amortization Calculation

```
Annual deduction = Total points / Number of months in loan term x Months in tax year
```

**Example:** $3,600 in points on a 30-year (360-month) refinance:
- Monthly deduction: $3,600 / 360 = $10/month
- If 6 months remain in the year: $10 x 6 = $60 deductible for the year

### Unamortized Points on Refinancing or Payoff

If you refinance with a **different lender** or pay off the mortgage early, you may deduct the **remaining unamortized points** in the year of payoff.

If you refinance with the **same lender**, the remaining unamortized points from the old loan must be combined with the points on the new loan and amortized over the new loan term.

### Seller-Paid Points

If the **seller** pays points on behalf of the buyer:
- The **buyer** may deduct the seller-paid points (if all conditions above are met).
- The buyer must **reduce the basis** of the home by the amount of seller-paid points.
- The seller cannot deduct seller-paid points as interest; they are treated as a selling expense.

## 6. Form 1098 (Mortgage Interest Statement)

### What Is Reported

Your mortgage lender provides **Form 1098** by January 31, showing:

| Box | Information |
|-----|-------------|
| Box 1 | Mortgage interest received (including points) |
| Box 2 | Outstanding mortgage principal |
| Box 3 | Mortgage origination date |
| Box 4 | Refund of overpaid interest |
| Box 5 | Mortgage insurance premiums |
| Box 6 | Points paid on purchase of principal residence |

### Using Form 1098

- Report the deductible portion of Box 1 on Schedule A, line 8a (if the mortgage is from a financial institution).
- If your deductible interest differs from Box 1 (e.g., due to debt limits), attach a statement explaining the difference.
- If you paid interest to an individual (not a financial institution), report on Schedule A, line 8b, and provide the recipient's name, address, and SSN or EIN.

### Multiple Properties or Lenders

If you received more than one Form 1098, add the amounts and report the total. If only a portion is deductible (due to debt limits), you will need to calculate the deductible portion using the worksheets in Publication 936.

## 7. Refinancing Rules

### Refinancing Acquisition Debt

When you refinance a mortgage that was treated as acquisition indebtedness:

- The **new mortgage** is treated as acquisition debt **up to the balance of the old mortgage** at the time of refinancing.
- Any amount of the new mortgage **exceeding the balance of the old mortgage** is not acquisition debt unless the excess is used to buy, build, or substantially improve the qualified residence.

### Example

| Item | Amount |
|------|--------|
| Balance of old mortgage (acquisition debt) | $300,000 |
| New refinanced mortgage | $350,000 |
| Amount treated as acquisition debt | $300,000 |
| Excess (not acquisition debt unless for home improvement) | $50,000 |

### Refinancing and Grandfathered Debt

- Refinancing grandfathered debt (pre-October 14, 1987) retains grandfathered status **up to the old mortgage balance**.
- Any increase over the old balance is treated under the rules applicable at the time of refinancing ($1M or $750K limit).

### Cash-Out Refinance

If you take out a new mortgage for more than the existing balance and receive cash:

- Interest on the portion up to the old balance remains deductible as acquisition debt interest.
- Interest on the cash-out portion is deductible **only if** the funds are used to substantially improve the qualified residence (under TCJA rules for 2018-2025).
- If the cash-out funds are used for other purposes (debt consolidation, personal expenses), interest on that portion is **not deductible** for 2018-2025.

---

## 8. Prepaid Interest

### General Rule

Prepaid interest is interest paid in the current year that is allocable to a period
**after** the end of the tax year. Prepaid interest is generally **not deductible** in
the year paid but must be allocated to the tax year(s) to which it applies.

### Exception for Points

Points that meet the requirements in Section 5 are treated as deductible in the year
paid, even though they represent prepaid interest.

### Mortgage Interest Paid at Closing

Interest paid at closing for the period from the closing date through the end of the
month is deductible in the year paid (this is the per-diem interest charge typically
shown on the closing statement).

---

## 9. Second Home Rules

### Selecting a Second Home

- You may treat **one** additional home (other than your main home) as a qualified residence.
- You may change your selection each year.
- If you own more than two homes, you choose which one to treat as your second home for the year.

### Personal Use Requirement for Rented Second Homes

If you **rent out** the second home during the year, you must also **use it as a home** for more than the greater of:

- **14 days**, or
- **10% of the number of days** it is rented at a fair rental value

during the year. If you fail this test, the property is treated as a rental property, and mortgage interest is allocated under the rental expense rules (Schedule E), not the home mortgage interest deduction (Schedule A).

### Second Home Not Rented

If the second home is **never rented**, there is no personal use requirement. All qualifying mortgage interest on the second home is deductible on Schedule A (subject to the debt limits).

---

## 10. Mixed-Use and Rental Allocation

### When Allocation Is Required

If a home is used partly as a personal residence and partly as a rental property, or partly for business (home office), mortgage interest must be **allocated** between the personal and business/rental portions.

### Rental Property Allocation

- If a second home fails the personal use test (see Section 9), it is treated entirely as a rental property.
- Mortgage interest allocable to the rental use is deducted on **Schedule E** (subject to passive activity rules) rather than Schedule A.
- The personal-use portion of interest may be deductible on Schedule A only if the property qualifies as a second home.

### Home Office (Schedule C / Form 8829)

- If you use a portion of your main home exclusively and regularly for business, the business percentage of mortgage interest is deducted on **Schedule C** (via Form 8829) rather than Schedule A.
- The remaining personal-use percentage of interest is deductible on Schedule A (subject to debt limits).
- Avoid double-counting: interest deducted on Schedule C / Form 8829 cannot also be deducted on Schedule A.

### Allocation Methods

- **By time:** Divide total days of personal use vs. rental/business use.
- **By space:** Divide total square footage of personal vs. business/rental use (home office).
- The method depends on the type of allocation required and must be applied consistently.

---

## 11. What You Cannot Deduct

The following mortgage-related expenses are **not** deductible as home mortgage interest:

- **Insurance premiums** (homeowner's insurance, title insurance, PMI -- though mortgage insurance premiums have had a separate deduction in some years; check current law)
- **FHA or VA funding fees** (these may be deductible as points if they meet the requirements)
- **Principal payments** (only interest is deductible)
- **Settlement or closing costs** other than deductible points (title fees, appraisal fees, attorney fees, recording fees)
- **Deposits, down payments, or earnest money**
- **Interest on a loan not secured by the home** (personal loans, credit cards)
- **Home equity loan interest used for non-home purposes** (2018-2025 under TCJA)
- **Reverse mortgage interest** (deductible only when actually paid, typically at loan termination)
- **Late payment charges** (may be deductible if they are interest and not a penalty)
- **Mortgage interest on a third home** (only main home and one second home qualify)

---

## 12. Worksheets and Calculations

### When Worksheets Are Needed

You need to use the Publication 936 worksheets to calculate deductible interest when:

- Total mortgage debt exceeds the applicable limit ($750K or $1M).
- You have mortgages from multiple time periods (grandfathered, pre-TCJA, post-TCJA).
- You refinanced and the new balance exceeds the old balance.
- You have both acquisition debt and non-qualifying home equity debt.

### Average Mortgage Balance Method

When debt exceeds limits, the IRS generally allows calculating the deductible portion using the **average balance** of the mortgage during the year:

```
Average balance = (Beginning balance + Ending balance) / 2
```

If the average balance is at or below the applicable limit, all interest is deductible. If above, interest is deductible proportionally:

```
Deductible interest = Total interest x (Applicable limit / Average balance)
```

### Example (Post-TCJA Debt Exceeding Limit)

| Item | Amount |
|------|--------|
| Average mortgage balance | $1,000,000 |
| Applicable limit (post-TCJA) | $750,000 |
| Total interest paid | $50,000 |
| Deductible interest: $50,000 x ($750,000 / $1,000,000) | **$37,500** |
