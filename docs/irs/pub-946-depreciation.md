## 1. Overview

Publication 946 explains how to recover the cost of business or income-producing property through deductions for depreciation. The three primary cost recovery mechanisms are:

1. **Section 179 deduction** -- immediate expensing of qualifying property
2. **Bonus depreciation (special depreciation allowance)** -- first-year accelerated deduction
3. **MACRS depreciation** -- systematic cost recovery over a prescribed recovery period

The order of application is: Section 179 first, then bonus depreciation on the remaining basis, then regular MACRS depreciation on any remaining balance.

---

## 2. Section 179 Deduction

The Section 179 deduction allows taxpayers to elect to expense the cost of qualifying property in the year it is placed in service, rather than depreciating it over multiple years.

### 2025 Limits (OBBBA -- P.L. 119-21)

| Item | Amount |
|------|--------|
| **Maximum deduction** | **$2,500,000** |
| **Phase-out threshold** | **$4,000,000** |
| **Phase-out complete** | $6,500,000 ($2.5M + $4M) |
| **SUV limitation** | **$31,300** |

- The OBBBA increased the maximum deduction from $1,160,000 (prior law for 2025) to **$2,500,000** and the phase-out threshold from $2,890,000 to **$4,000,000**.
- Effective for property **placed in service after December 31, 2024**.
- Both the deduction limit and phase-out threshold are **indexed to inflation** in future years.

### Phase-Out Rule

The $2,500,000 maximum deduction is reduced dollar-for-dollar by the amount of Section 179 property placed in service during the year that exceeds the $4,000,000 threshold.

**Example:** If a taxpayer places $4,300,000 of qualifying property in service in 2025, the Section 179 deduction is reduced by $300,000 ($4,300,000 - $4,000,000) to **$2,200,000**.

### SUV Limitation

For **sport utility vehicles** with a gross vehicle weight rating (GVWR) above 6,000 lbs but not more than 14,000 lbs, the Section 179 deduction is limited to **$31,300** for 2025 ($30,500 for 2024). This cap applies only to SUVs; it does not apply to vehicles that are not SUVs (e.g., pickup trucks with a cargo bed at least 6 feet long, vans with no seating behind the driver).

### Taxable Income Limitation

The Section 179 deduction **cannot exceed** the aggregate taxable income from all of the taxpayer's **active trades or businesses** during the year. This includes:
- Wages and salary
- Net income from Schedule C
- Net rental income (if treated as active trade or business)
- Guaranteed payments for services

If the Section 179 deduction is limited by taxable income, the excess amount is **carried forward** to subsequent years (subject to the same limits in those years).

### Qualifying Property

Section 179 applies to:
- Tangible personal property (machinery, equipment, furniture, fixtures)
- Off-the-shelf computer software
- Qualified improvement property (QIP)
- Certain improvements to nonresidential real property (roofs, HVAC, fire protection, alarm systems, security systems)
- Single-purpose agricultural or horticultural structures
- Facilities used for bulk storage of fungible commodities

Section 179 does **not** apply to:
- Property used predominantly outside the United States
- Property used predominantly to furnish lodging (with exceptions)
- Property acquired from related parties
- Property acquired by gift, inheritance, or trade unless additional cash is paid
- Air conditioning or heating units
- Residential rental property (27.5-year real property)
- Nonresidential real property (39-year) except for qualifying improvements listed above

---

## 3. Bonus Depreciation (Special Depreciation Allowance)

### 2025 Rules (OBBBA)

The OBBBA reinstates and makes permanent **100% first-year bonus depreciation** for qualified property:

| Acquisition / Placed in Service | Bonus Rate |
|--------------------------------|------------|
| Acquired **after** January 19, 2025, and placed in service in 2025+ | **100%** (permanent) |
| Acquired **on or before** January 19, 2025, and placed in service in 2025 | **40%** (prior law phase-down) |
| Placed in service January 1-19, 2025 (regardless of acquisition date) | **40%** (prior law phase-down) |
| Placed in service in 2024 | **60%** (retroactively restored to 100% by OBBBA) |
| Placed in service in 2023 | **80%** (retroactively restored to 100% by OBBBA) |

### Qualifying Property for Bonus Depreciation

- MACRS property with a recovery period of **20 years or less**
- Water utility property
- Computer software (not Section 197 intangibles)
- Qualified improvement property (QIP)
- Certain film, television, and live theatrical productions
- Specified plants bearing fruit or nuts

### Property NOT Eligible for Bonus Depreciation

- Property with a recovery period greater than 20 years (including 27.5-year residential rental and 39-year nonresidential)
- Property required to use the Alternative Depreciation System (ADS)
- Property for which the taxpayer elected out of bonus depreciation
- **Listed property** used 50% or less for business
- Floor plan financing interest property (auto dealers)

### Election Out

A taxpayer may elect **out** of bonus depreciation for any class of property placed in service during the year. The election is made on a class-by-class basis (e.g., elect out for 5-year property but keep it for 7-year property). The election is **irrevocable** without IRS consent.

### Qualified Production Property (QPP) -- New Under OBBBA

The OBBBA creates a new elective **100% depreciation allowance** for qualified production property placed in service through 2030, potentially including certain commercial and industrial real property that would otherwise be excluded from standard bonus depreciation.

---

## 4. MACRS -- Modified Accelerated Cost Recovery System

MACRS is the primary depreciation system for most tangible property placed in service after 1986. It consists of two systems:

- **GDS (General Depreciation System)** -- used for most property; shorter recovery periods and accelerated methods
- **ADS (Alternative Depreciation System)** -- required for certain property; longer recovery periods and straight-line method

### GDS Recovery Periods Table

| Recovery Period | Depreciation Method | Property Examples |
|----------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **3-year** | 200% DB | Tractor units, racehorses (2+ years old), qualified rent-to-own property, certain manufacturing tools |
| **5-year** | 200% DB | Automobiles, light trucks, computers and peripherals, office machinery (copiers, calculators, typewriters), appliances, carpeting, and furniture used in **residential rental** activity, research and experimental equipment |
| **7-year** | 200% DB | Office furniture and fixtures, agricultural machinery, any property without a designated class life, railroad track, motorsports entertainment complexes |
| **10-year** | 200% DB | Vessels, barges, tugs, single-purpose agricultural/horticultural structures, fruit- or nut-bearing trees/vines (pre-productive period), assets used in petroleum refining |
| **15-year** | 150% DB | Land improvements (sidewalks, roads, fences, landscaping, shrubbery, bridges), retail motor fuel outlets, municipal wastewater treatment, qualified improvement property (QIP), certain electric/gas utility property |
| **20-year** | 150% DB | Farm buildings (non-single-purpose), municipal sewers, certain railroad structures, initial clearing and grading of land for electric utility transmission |
| **25-year** | Straight-line | Water utility property, municipal sewers placed in service after June 12, 1996 |
| **27.5-year** | Straight-line | **Residential rental property** (buildings where 80%+ of gross rental income is from dwelling units) |
| **39-year** | Straight-line | **Nonresidential real property** (office buildings, stores, warehouses not meeting the 80% residential test) |

### Key Notes on Recovery Periods

- **Qualified Improvement Property (QIP):** Interior improvements to nonresidential real property placed in service after the building is first placed in service. 15-year recovery under GDS (eligible for bonus depreciation).
- **Land** is **never depreciable**.
- **Residential rental buildings (27.5-year)** and **nonresidential real property (39-year)** are **not eligible** for bonus depreciation under standard rules (though QPP provisions under OBBBA may provide alternatives).

---

## 5. Conventions

Conventions determine how much depreciation is allowed in the **first year** and the **last year** of the recovery period.

### Half-Year Convention

- **Default convention** for personal property (3-, 5-, 7-, 10-, 15-, 20-year property)
- Treats all property placed in service (or disposed of) during the year as placed in service (or disposed of) at the **midpoint of the year**
- Result: one-half year of depreciation in the first and last years of the recovery period

### Mid-Quarter Convention

- **Required** if more than **40%** of the aggregate basis of all personal property placed in service during the year is placed in service during the **last quarter** (October-December for calendar year taxpayers)
- Treats all property placed in service during any quarter as placed in service at the **midpoint of that quarter**
- Effect: Property placed in service in Q4 gets less first-year depreciation; property placed in service in Q1 gets more

### Mid-Month Convention

- Used for **real property** (27.5-year and 39-year property)
- Treats all real property placed in service (or disposed of) during any month as placed in service (or disposed of) at the **midpoint of that month**
- Result: a half-month of depreciation for the month placed in service

---

## 6. Depreciation Methods

### 200% Declining Balance (200% DB)

- Used for **3-, 5-, 7-, and 10-year** GDS property
- Depreciation rate = (1 / recovery period) x 2
- Switches to **straight-line** in the year straight-line produces a larger deduction
- Example: 5-year property --> first-year rate = (1/5) x 2 = 40% (before convention adjustment)

### 150% Declining Balance (150% DB)

- Used for **15- and 20-year** GDS property
- Also used for all **farm property** (any recovery period) unless the taxpayer elects 200% DB for non-farm property
- Depreciation rate = (1 / recovery period) x 1.5
- Switches to **straight-line** in the optimal year
- Required for property under ADS for certain categories

### Straight-Line (SL)

- Used for **real property** (25-, 27.5-, and 39-year property)
- Used under ADS for all property classes
- May be **elected** for any class of property (irrevocable election, applies to all property in that class placed in service during the year)
- Rate = 1 / recovery period (adjusted for applicable convention)

### Method Summary Table

| Recovery Period | GDS Method | ADS Method | ADS Recovery Period |
|----------------|-----------|------------|-------------------|
| 3-year | 200% DB/SL | SL | 12 years |
| 5-year | 200% DB/SL | SL | 12 years |
| 7-year | 200% DB/SL | SL | 12 years |
| 10-year | 200% DB/SL | SL | varies |
| 15-year | 150% DB/SL | SL | 20 years |
| 20-year | 150% DB/SL | SL | 25 years |
| 27.5-year | SL | SL | 30 years |
| 39-year | SL | SL | 40 years |

## 7. Listed Property

### Definition

Listed property includes property that by its nature lends itself to personal use. The primary categories are:

- **Passenger automobiles** (GVWR of 6,000 lbs or less)
- Any other property used for **transportation** (motorcycles, pickups, SUVs -- subject to exceptions)
- Property used for **entertainment, recreation, or amusement** (no longer specifically listed after TCJA, but vehicles remain)

**Note:** Computers and peripheral equipment were removed from listed property by the TCJA (effective for property placed in service after December 31, 2017).

### More-Than-50% Business Use Requirement

| Business Use Percentage | Treatment |
|------------------------|-----------|
| **More than 50%** | Section 179, bonus depreciation, and MACRS (200% DB) are all available |
| **50% or less** | Must use **ADS straight-line** depreciation; no Section 179 or bonus depreciation |

### Recapture When Business Use Drops to 50% or Less

If, in any year during the recovery period, business use drops to **50% or less**, the taxpayer must:
1. Switch to **ADS straight-line** for the current and remaining years
2. **Recapture** as ordinary income the excess depreciation previously claimed (the difference between accelerated depreciation taken and what would have been allowed under ADS straight-line)

### Passenger Automobile Depreciation Limits (2025)

Annual depreciation (including Section 179 and bonus) for passenger automobiles (GVWR <= 6,000 lbs) is capped:

| Year | With Bonus Depreciation | Without Bonus Depreciation |
|------|------------------------|---------------------------|
| Year 1 | $20,200 | $12,200 |
| Year 2 | $19,600 | $19,600 |
| Year 3 | $11,800 | $11,800 |
| Year 4+ | $7,060 | $7,060 |

For vehicles with a GVWR **over 6,000 lbs** (heavy SUVs, trucks), the annual caps do not apply, but the **$31,300 Section 179 SUV limit** applies. The remaining cost above $31,300 can be depreciated using bonus depreciation (100% post-1/19/2025) and regular MACRS.

### Substantiation Requirements

Taxpayers must maintain **adequate records** or sufficient evidence to substantiate the business use of listed property:
- Amount of each business use
- Date of use
- Business purpose
- If a vehicle: mileage for each business trip, total mileage for the year, date placed in service, and total mileage for the year

---

## 8. Depreciation Recapture

When depreciable property is sold, exchanged, or otherwise disposed of at a gain, some or all of the depreciation previously taken may be **recaptured** as ordinary income rather than treated as capital gain.

### Section 1245 Recapture (Personal Property)

Applies to: depreciable **personal property** (machinery, equipment, vehicles, furniture, etc.) and certain other Section 1245 property.

| Rule | Detail |
|------|--------|
| **Scope** | All depreciation taken (including Section 179 and bonus depreciation) |
| **Treatment** | Gain is taxed as **ordinary income** up to the total depreciation taken |
| **Tax rate** | Ordinary income rates (up to **37%** for 2025) |
| **Remaining gain** | Any gain exceeding total depreciation is treated as Section 1231 gain (potentially long-term capital gain at 0%, 15%, or 20%) |

**Example:** Equipment purchased for $50,000, depreciated $30,000, sold for $55,000.
- Gain = $55,000 - $20,000 (adjusted basis) = $35,000
- Section 1245 recapture (ordinary income) = $30,000 (total depreciation taken)
- Section 1231 gain (capital gain) = $5,000

### Section 1250 Recapture (Real Property)

Applies to: depreciable **real property** (buildings, structural components).

| Rule | Detail |
|------|--------|
| **Scope** | Only the **excess** of accelerated depreciation over straight-line depreciation |
| **Treatment** | Excess depreciation is taxed as **ordinary income** |
| **Practical impact** | Rarely triggers because most real property placed in service after 1986 uses **straight-line** depreciation under MACRS (no excess over straight-line) |

### Unrecaptured Section 1250 Gain

For real property depreciated under the straight-line method (the normal case for MACRS real property), gain attributable to depreciation is taxed at a **maximum rate of 25%** rather than ordinary income rates. This is called **unrecaptured Section 1250 gain**.

| Component | Tax Rate |
|-----------|----------|
| Unrecaptured Section 1250 gain (depreciation taken via straight-line) | **25% maximum** |
| Remaining gain above original cost | Long-term capital gain rates (0%, 15%, or 20%) |
| Net investment income surtax (if applicable) | Additional **3.8%** |

**Example:** Rental building purchased for $275,000 (building only), depreciated $100,000 over 10 years, sold for $350,000.
- Adjusted basis = $275,000 - $100,000 = $175,000
- Total gain = $350,000 - $175,000 = $175,000
- Unrecaptured Section 1250 gain (taxed at max 25%) = $100,000
- Remaining gain (taxed at LTCG rates) = $75,000

### Section 1245 vs. 1250 Summary

| Feature | Section 1245 | Section 1250 |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
| Property type | Personal property (equipment, vehicles, etc.) | Real property (buildings) |
| Recapture amount | All depreciation taken | Only excess over straight-line |
| Tax rate on recapture | Ordinary income (up to 37%) | Ordinary income (up to 37%) |
| Practical note | Almost always applies | Rarely applies (most use SL) |
| Unrecaptured gain (SL portion) | N/A | Taxed at max 25% |

## 9. Alternative Depreciation System (ADS)

ADS **must** be used for:
- Property used predominantly **outside the United States**
- Tax-exempt use property
- Tax-exempt bond-financed property
- Property used in a **farming business** (if the taxpayer elects out of the uniform capitalization rules)
- Certain imported property from non-treaty countries
- Property for which the taxpayer elects ADS (irrevocable)
- Real property held by an **electing real property trade or business** under Section 163(j)
- Real property held by an **electing farming business** under Section 163(j)

ADS uses **straight-line** depreciation and generally longer recovery periods than GDS.

---

## 10. Form 4562 Filing Requirements

Form 4562 must be filed if you are claiming:
- Depreciation on property placed in service during 2025
- A Section 179 deduction
- Bonus depreciation (special depreciation allowance)
- Depreciation on any listed property
- Amortization that begins in 2025

If you are only claiming depreciation on property placed in service in **prior years** and are not claiming Section 179, bonus depreciation, or listed property depreciation, you may report the depreciation directly on Schedule E, Schedule C, or the applicable form **without** filing Form 4562.
