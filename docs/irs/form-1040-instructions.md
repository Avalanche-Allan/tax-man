## Filing Status

### Filing Status Definitions

**Single** -- If on the last day of the year, you are unmarried or legally separated from your spouse under a divorce or separate maintenance decree, and you do not qualify for another filing status.

**Married Filing Jointly (MFJ)** -- You can file a joint return if you are married and both you and your spouse agree to file a joint return. On a joint return, you report your combined income and deduct your combined allowable expenses. You can file a joint return even if one of you had no income or deductions. If your spouse died during the year, you can generally still file a joint return for that year.

**Married Filing Separately (MFS)** -- If you are married, you can choose to file separate returns. This status may benefit you if you want to be responsible only for your own tax or if it results in less tax than filing a joint return. The MFS filing status carries several limitations:
- Your tax rate generally will be higher than on a joint return.
- Your exemption amount for AMT is half of MFJ.
- Many credits are reduced or eliminated (e.g., EIC, education credits).
- The QBI deduction threshold is halved ($197,300 vs. $394,600 MFJ).
- Additional Medicare Tax threshold is $125,000 (vs. $250,000 MFJ).
- NIIT threshold is $125,000 (vs. $250,000 MFJ).
- Passive rental loss $25,000 special allowance is $0.
- Capital loss deduction limit is $1,500 (vs. $3,000).
- Senior bonus deduction: MFS filers are EXCLUDED.

**Head of Household (HOH)** -- You may file as head of household if you meet all the following requirements:
1. You are unmarried or considered unmarried on the last day of the year.
2. You paid more than half the cost of keeping up a home for the year.
3. A qualifying person lived with you in the home for more than half the year (except for temporary absences, such as school). An exception applies if the qualifying person is your dependent parent; they do not have to live with you.

**Qualifying Surviving Spouse (QSS)** -- You may use this filing status for 2 years following the year your spouse died if:
1. You were entitled to file a joint return with your spouse for the year your spouse died (you do not have to have actually filed a joint return).
2. Your spouse died in 2023 or 2024, and you did not remarry before the end of 2025.
3. You have a child, stepchild, or adopted child whom you can claim as a dependent (a foster child does not qualify).
4. This child lived in your home all year, except for temporary absences.
5. You paid more than half the cost of keeping up your home for the year.

### Filing Requirements (Gross Income Thresholds)

You must file a return if your gross income equals or exceeds these amounts:

| Filing Status | Under 65 | 65 or Older |

| Single | $15,750 | $17,750 |

| MFS | $5 (any age) | $5 (any age) |
| HOH | $23,625 | $25,625 |
| QSS | $31,500 | $33,100 |

**You must also file if any of these apply regardless of income:**

## Standard Deduction

### 2025 Standard Deduction Amounts (Post-OBBBA)

OBBBA Section 101 increased the standard deduction above the Rev. Proc. 2024-40 amounts. Pre-OBBBA amounts are shown for reference.

| Filing Status | Pre-OBBBA | Post-OBBBA (Actual 2025) |
|---|---|---|
| Single | $15,000 | **$15,750** |
| Married Filing Jointly | $30,000 | **$31,500** |
| Married Filing Separately | $15,000 | **$15,750** |
| Head of Household | $22,500 | **$23,625** |
| Qualifying Surviving Spouse | $30,000 | **$31,500** |

### Additional Standard Deduction (Age 65+ or Blind)

Per qualifying condition, per person:

| Filing Status | Additional Amount |
|---|---|
| Single or HOH | $2,000 |
| MFJ, MFS, or QSS | $1,550 |

If you are 65 or older AND blind, you get both amounts (i.e., $4,000 for single/HOH, $3,100 for married).

### Senior Bonus Deduction (OBBBA, New for 2025)

OBBBA creates an additional deduction of **$6,000** for individuals age 65 or older. This is per eligible individual -- a married couple where both spouses qualify can claim **$12,000** total.

**Phase-out:** The deduction phases out for taxpayers with modified AGI over:
- $75,000 (Single, HOH, MFS)
- $150,000 (MFJ, QSS)

**Exclusion:** MFS filers are **excluded** from the senior bonus deduction.

**Duration:** Available for tax years 2025 through 2028.

### When You Cannot Use the Standard Deduction

You cannot use the standard deduction if:
- You are married and filing separately, and your spouse itemizes deductions.
- You are filing a tax return for a short tax year because of a change in your annual accounting period.
- You are a nonresident or dual-status alien during the year.

You may itemize deductions if your total itemized deductions exceed your standard deduction. Key categories:

The QBI deduction allows eligible taxpayers to deduct up to **20%** of their qualified business income from sole proprietorships, partnerships, S corporations, trusts, and estates.

**QBI Sources:**
- Schedule C net profit (sole proprietorship)
- K-1 Box 20, Code Z (partnerships/S corps -- non-SSTB income)

**Below threshold:** Simple calculation -- 20% of QBI, limited to 20% of taxable income before QBI deduction (Form 8995).

**Above threshold:** W-2 wage / UBIA capital limitations apply (Form 8995-A):
- Deduction limited to the **greater of**:
  - 50% of W-2 wages paid by the qualified business, OR
  - 25% of W-2 wages + 2.5% of UBIA (unadjusted basis immediately after acquisition of qualified property)
- This limit phases in over the phase-out range above the threshold.

**SSTB (Specified Service Trade or Business) Rule:**
- If taxable income exceeds the upper end of the phase-out range, QBI from SSTBs (e.g., health, law, accounting, consulting, athletics, financial services) is **completely disallowed**.

**OBBBA Change:** The QBI deduction is now **permanent** (sunset provision removed).

### Line 15 -- Taxable Income

**Taxable Income = AGI - Standard Deduction (or Itemized) - QBI Deduction**

## Self-Employment Tax (Schedule SE)

### Overview

Self-employment tax is the Social Security and Medicare tax for individuals who work for themselves. It applies to net self-employment earnings of **$400 or more**.

### 2025 Rates and Thresholds

| Component | Rate | Wage Base |
|---|---|---|
| Social Security | 12.4% | $176,100 |
| Medicare | 2.9% | No limit |
| **Total SE Tax** | **15.3%** | SS portion capped at wage base |

### Calculation (Schedule SE, Section A)

1. **Line 3 -- Net SE Earnings:** Combined net profit from all Schedule C businesses plus K-1 Box 14 self-employment earnings.
2. **Line 4a -- 92.35% Factor:** Multiply net SE earnings by 0.9235. This is the taxable SE earnings.
3. **Social Security Tax:** 12.4% on the lesser of taxable SE earnings or ($176,100 minus W-2 Social Security wages).
4. **Medicare Tax:** 2.9% on all taxable SE earnings (no cap).
5. **Line 12 -- Total SE Tax:** Sum of SS tax and Medicare tax.
6. **Line 13 -- Deductible Portion:** 50% of SE tax. This goes to Schedule 1, Line 15 as an adjustment to income.

### Maximum Social Security Tax (2025)

- Maximum SS tax on SE income: 12.4% x $176,100 = **$21,836.40**
- W-2 SS wages reduce the remaining SS wage base available for SE tax

### Additional Medicare Tax (Form 8959)

An additional **0.9%** Medicare tax applies to combined wages + SE earnings exceeding:

| Filing Status | Threshold |
|---|---|
| Single / HOH | $200,000 |
| MFJ / QSS | $250,000 |
| MFS | $125,000 |

## Schedule 1-A (New for 2025 -- OBBBA Deductions)

## Foreign Earned Income Exclusion (Form 2555)

### 2025 Exclusion Limit

- **Maximum exclusion:** $130,000 of foreign earned income.
- **Housing exclusion base:** $20,800 (16% of exclusion limit).
- **Housing exclusion maximum:** $39,000 (30% of exclusion limit, default; high-cost cities may be higher).

### Key Rules

- FEIE only excludes income from **income tax**, NOT from **self-employment tax**.
- The exclusion uses the "stacking method" to compute the tax benefit: tax is computed on full income, then tax on the excluded amount is subtracted.
- The exclusion reduces the income subject to income tax but does NOT affect the SE tax calculation.
