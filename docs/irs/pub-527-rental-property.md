## 1. Rental Income

All amounts received as rent must be included in gross income. Report rental income on **Schedule E (Form 1040), Part I**.

### Types of Rental Income

| Type | Treatment |
|------|-----------|
| **Rent payments** | Include in income when received (cash basis) or when earned (accrual basis) |
| **Advance rent** | Include in income in the year **received**, regardless of the period covered or accounting method |
| **Security deposits** | **Not income** when received if you plan to return it; income only if you keep any portion (e.g., for unpaid rent or damages) |
| **Lease cancellation payments** | Include in income in the year received; treated as rent |
| **Property or services in lieu of rent** | Include at **fair market value** of the property or services received |
| **Tenant-paid expenses** | If tenant pays any of your expenses (e.g., utility bills, repair costs), those payments are rental income; you may also deduct the corresponding expense |
| **Improvement in lieu of rent** | If tenant makes improvements in lieu of rent, include the FMV of improvements as rental income |

### Minimal Rental Use Exception

If you rent out a dwelling unit for **fewer than 15 days** during the year, you do **not** report any rental income and cannot deduct any rental expenses (other than those otherwise deductible, such as mortgage interest and real estate taxes on Schedule A).

---

## 2. Rental Expenses

You may deduct the **ordinary and necessary** expenses of managing, conserving, and maintaining your rental property. Expenses are deducted on Schedule E.

### Deductible Rental Expenses

| Expense Category | Notes |
|-----------------|-------|
| **Advertising** | Cost of advertising the property for rent |
| **Auto and travel** | Travel to rental property for management, repairs, or rent collection (standard mileage rate: **$0.70/mile** for 2025); no deduction for commuting |
| **Cleaning and maintenance** | Cleaning between tenants, yard care, pest control |
| **Commissions** | Amounts paid to rental agents or property managers for obtaining tenants |
| **Insurance** | Fire, theft, flood, and landlord liability premiums |
| **Legal and professional fees** | Attorney fees, tax preparation fees for Schedule E, eviction costs |
| **Management fees** | Property management company fees |
| **Mortgage interest** | Interest on loans used to acquire, build, or improve the rental property (Form 1098) |
| **Other interest** | Interest on loans for rental property improvements |
| **Repairs** | Amounts paid to keep property in ordinary, efficient operating condition (see Repairs vs. Improvements below) |
| **Taxes** | Real estate taxes, personal property taxes on rental equipment |
| **Utilities** | Gas, electric, water, sewer, trash collection if paid by landlord |
| **Depreciation** | Cost recovery of the building and improvements (see Section 3) |
| **Points** | Points paid to obtain a mortgage must generally be amortized over the life of the loan |

### Repairs vs. Improvements

| Repairs (currently deductible) | Improvements (must be capitalized and depreciated) |
|-------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| Fixing leaks | Adding a room or deck |
| Repainting | Installing new plumbing or wiring |
| Replacing broken windows | Installing a new roof |
| Patching holes in walls | Paving a driveway |
| Fixing floors | Installing new HVAC system |
| Minor plumbing fixes | Kitchen or bathroom remodel |

An **improvement** adds to the value of the property, prolongs its useful life, or adapts it to new uses. Improvements are depreciated as if they were separate property.

## 3. Depreciation of Rental Property

### Residential Rental Buildings

- Recovery period: **27.5 years** under MACRS GDS
- Method: **Straight-line**
- Convention: **Mid-month** (property placed in service in the middle of the month)
- Land is **never depreciable** -- only the building and improvements
- Must separate land value from building value at acquisition

### Personal Property Used in Rental Activity

| Property Type | Recovery Period | Method |
|--------------|----------------|--------|
| Appliances (stove, refrigerator, washer/dryer) | 5 years | 200% DB |
| Carpeting | 5 years | 200% DB |
| Furniture | 5 or 7 years | 200% DB |
| Land improvements (sidewalks, fencing, landscaping) | 15 years | 150% DB |

### 2025 Changes (OBBBA)

- **100% bonus depreciation** restored for qualified property acquired and placed in service **after January 19, 2025**. Applies to personal property (appliances, furniture, land improvements) but **not** to the residential rental building itself (27.5-year property is excluded from bonus depreciation).
- Property placed in service between January 1-19, 2025, or acquired on or before January 19, 2025, remains subject to prior phase-down rules (40% for 2025 under prior law).
- **Section 179:** Maximum deduction increased to **$2,500,000** (phase-out begins at $4,000,000). Generally not available for residential rental real property placed in service by a landlord, but may apply to certain personal property used in rental activity if the taxpayer is actively conducting a rental trade or business.

### Basis for Depreciation

The depreciable basis is generally the **lesser of**:
- The property's **fair market value** at the time of conversion to rental use, or
- The **adjusted basis** (original cost + improvements - casualty losses - prior depreciation)

---

## 4. Passive Activity Loss Rules

Rental activities are generally treated as **passive activities**, regardless of the taxpayer's level of participation. Losses from passive activities can generally only offset passive income.

### $25,000 Special Allowance

Taxpayers who **actively participate** in rental real estate activities may deduct up to **$25,000** of rental real estate losses against nonpassive income (wages, portfolio income, etc.).

#### Requirements for Active Participation

- Taxpayer (and/or spouse) must own at least **10%** of the rental activity (by value)
- Taxpayer must make **management decisions** in a bona fide sense (approving tenants, setting rental terms, approving expenditures, etc.)
- Active participation is a **lower standard** than material participation
- A limited partner generally cannot actively participate

#### MAGI Phase-Out

| Modified AGI (MAGI) | Allowance Available |
|---------------------|-------------------|
| $100,000 or less | Full $25,000 |
| $100,001 - $149,999 | Reduced (loses $1 for every $2 over $100K) |
| $150,000 or more | **$0** (fully phased out) |

The allowance is reduced by **50% of the amount by which MAGI exceeds $100,000**.

**Example:** MAGI of $120,000 --> reduction = 50% x ($120,000 - $100,000) = $10,000 --> allowance = $25,000 - $10,000 = **$15,000**.

### Married Filing Separately (MFS) Limitations

- If spouses **lived together** at any time during the year: the special allowance is **$0** (no rental loss deduction against nonpassive income)
- If spouses lived **apart for the entire year**: each spouse may claim up to **$12,500** of the special allowance, with the MAGI phase-out starting at **$50,000** and fully phased out at **$75,000**

### Suspended Losses

Disallowed passive losses are **suspended** and carried forward to future years. They can be used to offset:
- Future passive income from **any** passive activity
- In the year of a fully taxable **disposition** of the rental activity, all suspended losses are released and deductible against any type of income

### Real Estate Professional Exception

A taxpayer who qualifies as a **real estate professional** can treat rental real estate activities as nonpassive:
1. More than **50%** of personal services performed during the year are in real property trades or businesses in which the taxpayer materially participates
2. More than **750 hours** of services performed during the year in real property trades or businesses in which the taxpayer materially participates
3. Must also **materially participate** in each rental activity (or elect to aggregate all rental activities under Reg. 1.469-9(g))

---

## 5. At-Risk Rules

Before applying the passive activity rules, rental losses are subject to the **at-risk rules** (Section 465). You can only deduct losses up to the amount you have **at risk** in the activity.

### Amount At Risk Includes

- Cash contributed to the activity
- Adjusted basis of property contributed
- Amounts borrowed for which you are **personally liable** (recourse debt)
- Amounts borrowed secured by property **other than** property used in the activity
- **Qualified nonrecourse financing** secured by real property used in the activity (special exception for real estate)

### Qualified Nonrecourse Financing

For real estate activities, certain nonrecourse financing from qualified lenders (banks, government entities) secured by the real property is treated as at-risk. This is a special carve-out that benefits real estate investors.

## 6. Personal Use Rules and Vacation Home Mixed-Use

### The 14-Day / 10% Test

A dwelling unit is treated as a **personal residence** (triggering vacation home rules) if personal use exceeds the **greater of**:
- **14 days**, or
- **10% of the total days** the unit is rented at fair rental value

### Personal Use Days Include

- Days used by the owner or family members
- Days rented to anyone at less than fair rental value
- Days used under a reciprocal arrangement with another property owner
- Days the unit is used by anyone under a shared equity financing agreement who does not pay fair rental value

### Three Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Rented Fewer Than 15 Days
- **No rental income** reported
- **No rental expenses** deducted (other than mortgage interest and taxes on Schedule A)
- All rental income is **tax-free**

#### Scenario 2: Rented 15+ Days AND Personal Use Exceeds the 14-Day/10% Limit
- Property is treated as a **personal residence** (vacation home)
- Rental income is reported
- Rental expenses are **limited to rental income** (no net rental loss allowed)
- Expenses must be allocated between personal and rental use based on the ratio of **rental days to total use days**
- Expenses are deducted in the following **priority order**:
  1. Tier 1: Mortgage interest and real estate taxes (allocated portion)
  2. Tier 2: Operating expenses (utilities, insurance, repairs -- allocated portion)
  3. Tier 3: Depreciation (allocated portion)
- Unused expenses carry forward to the next year

#### Scenario 3: Rented 15+ Days AND Personal Use Does NOT Exceed the 14-Day/10% Limit
- Treated as a **rental property** (not a personal residence)
- Full passive activity rules apply
- Net rental losses are potentially deductible (subject to passive loss rules)
- Expenses allocated between rental and personal use

### Allocation Methods

Expenses are allocated between rental and personal use. The IRS generally uses the ratio of rental days to total days used (rental + personal). Courts have sometimes allowed allocation of mortgage interest and taxes based on total days in the year (365 days), which can produce a more favorable result.

## 7. QBI Deduction for Rental Activities

### Section 199A Overview

Rental real estate income may qualify for the **20% Qualified Business Income (QBI) deduction** under Section 199A if the rental activity rises to the level of a **trade or business**.

### Safe Harbor: Revenue Procedure 2019-38

The IRS provides a safe harbor under **Rev. Proc. 2019-38** that allows taxpayers to treat a rental real estate enterprise as a trade or business for QBI purposes if the following requirements are met:

#### Requirements

1. Separate books and records are maintained for each rental real estate enterprise
2. **250 or more hours** of rental services are performed per year with respect to the enterprise:
   - For enterprises in existence **less than 4 years**: 250+ hours per year
   - For enterprises in existence **4+ years**: 250+ hours in at least **3 of the past 5 years**
3. The taxpayer maintains **contemporaneous records** including:
   - Hours of all services performed
   - Description of services
   - Dates of services
   - Who performed the services

#### Qualifying Rental Services (Count Toward 250 Hours)

- Advertising to rent or lease
- Negotiating and executing leases
- Verifying tenant applications
- Collecting rent
- Daily operation, maintenance, and repair
- Management of the property
- Purchase of materials
- Supervision of employees and contractors

#### Services That Do NOT Count

- Financial or investment management activities
- Studying and reviewing financial statements
- Planning, managing, or constructing long-term capital improvements
- Hours spent traveling to and from the rental property (generally)

#### Exclusions from Safe Harbor

The following types of rental activities **cannot** use the safe harbor:
- Property used as a residence under Section 280A (vacation home rules)
- Real estate rented under a **triple net lease**
- Property rented to a commonly controlled trade or business (treated as part of that business instead)

### Without the Safe Harbor

Even without the safe harbor, rental income may still qualify for QBI if the taxpayer can demonstrate the rental activity constitutes a **trade or business** under general tax principles (Section 162). Factors include the regularity and continuity of the activity, the taxpayer's intent, and whether significant services are provided to tenants.
