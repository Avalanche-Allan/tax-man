## General Information

Form 2555 is the IRS form used to claim the **Foreign Earned Income Exclusion (FEIE)**, the **Foreign Housing Exclusion**, and/or the **Foreign Housing Deduction** under Internal Revenue Code Section 911. It must be attached to Form 1040 or 1040-SR when filed.

For the **2025 tax year**, the maximum foreign earned income exclusion is **$130,000** (up from $126,500 in 2024).

---

## Who Qualifies

You may qualify for the foreign earned income exclusion and the housing exclusion or deduction if **all** of the following apply:

1. You are a **U.S. citizen** or a **U.S. resident alien**.
2. You meet the **tax home test** (your tax home must be in a foreign country).
3. You meet **either** the **bona fide residence test** or the **physical presence test**.

### Who Cannot Use Form 2555

- U.S. government employees or members of the U.S. Armed Forces (they may use Form 2555-EZ or have different rules).
- Nonresident aliens who are not also U.S. citizens.

---

## The Tax Home Test

Your **tax home** must be in a foreign country throughout your period of bona fide residence or physical presence abroad.

- Your **tax home** is your regular or principal place of business, employment, or post of duty, regardless of where you maintain your family residence.
- If you do not have a regular or principal place of business because of the nature of your trade or business, your tax home is your regular place of abode (the place where you regularly live).
- You are **not** considered to have a tax home in a foreign country for any period during which your abode is in the United States, unless you are serving in a designated combat zone.
- A temporary assignment in a foreign country does not make that location your tax home if your regular place of business is still in the United States.

---

## Foreign Country Defined

A **foreign country** is any territory under the sovereignty of a government other than that of the United States.

**Includes:**
- The country's territorial waters and airspace
- The seabed and subsoil of submarine areas adjacent to the country's territorial waters over which the country has exclusive rights under international law to explore and exploit natural resources

**Does NOT include:**
- U.S. possessions and territories (Puerto Rico, Guam, U.S. Virgin Islands, American Samoa, Northern Mariana Islands)
- The Antarctic region
- International waters and the airspace above them

---

## Bona Fide Residence Test

You meet the bona fide residence test if you are a **bona fide resident** of a foreign country or countries for an **uninterrupted period that includes an entire tax year** (January 1 through December 31 for calendar year taxpayers).

### Factors Considered

Whether you are a bona fide resident of a foreign country is determined by the facts of your situation and may include:

- Your **intention or purpose** for being in the foreign country
- The **nature and length** of your stay
- Your **activities** in the foreign country
- Whether you **paid taxes** to the foreign country
- Whether you established a **permanent home** there
- Whether you moved your **family** there
- Whether you maintained ties to the United States

### Key Rules

- If you go to a foreign country **to work for a specified period of time**, you ordinarily will **not** be regarded as a bona fide resident of that country, even though you work there for one tax year or longer.
- If you go there to work for an **indefinite or extended period** and you set up permanent quarters there for yourself and your family, you probably **have** established bona fide residence in a foreign country, even though you intend to return eventually.
- Once you have established bona fide residence for an uninterrupted period that includes an entire tax year, you will qualify as a bona fide resident for the period starting with the date you **began** your residency and ending with the date you **abandon** the foreign residence. This means you could qualify for parts of additional tax years beyond the full tax year(s).

### Temporary Absences

During your period of bona fide residence, you may leave that foreign country for brief or temporary trips back to the United States or elsewhere, so long as you clearly intend to return to your foreign residence (or to a new foreign bona fide residence) without unreasonable delay.

### Treaty Tiebreaker

If you are a U.S. citizen and use a treaty provision to claim tax residence in another country, you cannot claim bona fide residence in a foreign country for purposes of the FEIE.

## Physical Presence Test

You meet the physical presence test if you are **physically present in a foreign country or countries for at least 330 full days** during any period of **12 consecutive months**.

### Key Rules for Counting Days

- The **330 qualifying days do not have to be consecutive**.
- A **full day** means a period of 24 hours, beginning at midnight.
- The **12-month period** can be any period of 12 consecutive months; it does not have to be a calendar year.
- You do **not** have to begin the 12-month period with your first full day in a foreign country or end it with the day you leave. You can **choose the 12-month period** that gives you the greatest exclusion.
- You can count days spent abroad **for any reason**, so long as your tax home is in a foreign country.

### Travel Rules

- You can move about from one foreign country to another without losing full days.
- If any part of your travel is **not** within a foreign country or countries and takes **24 hours or more**, you will lose full days.
- If, in traveling from the United States to a foreign country, you pass over a foreign country before midnight of the day you leave, the first day you can count toward the 330-day total is the **day following the day you leave the United States**.
- Days spent traveling over international waters do **not** count as days in a foreign country.

### Days You Cannot Count

You do **not** meet the physical presence test if illness, family problems, a vacation, or your employer's orders prevent you from being physically present in a foreign country for at least 330 full days, regardless of the reason for the failure.

---

## Waiver of Time Requirements

If your tax home was in a foreign country and you were a bona fide resident of, or physically present in, a foreign country and **had to leave because of war, civil unrest, or similar adverse conditions**, the minimum time requirements specified under the bona fide residence and physical presence tests may be waived.

### Requirements for the Waiver

- You must be able to show that you could have **reasonably expected to meet the minimum time requirements** if you had not been required to leave.
- Each year, the IRS publishes in the **Internal Revenue Bulletin** a list of qualifying countries and the dates that qualify.
- If you left one of the listed countries during the indicated period, you can claim the tax benefits on Form 2555, but **only for the number of days** you were a bona fide resident of, or physically present in, the foreign country.

### How to Claim

- Enter **"Claiming Waiver"** in the top margin on page 1 of Form 2555.
- Attach a statement to your return explaining the waiver circumstances.

## What Counts as Foreign Earned Income

**Foreign earned income** is income you receive for services you perform in a foreign country during the period your tax home is in a foreign country and you meet either the bona fide residence test or the physical presence test.

### Earned Income INCLUDES:

- **Wages and salaries** for services performed abroad
- **Bonuses and commissions**
- **Professional fees**
- **Tips**
- **Self-employment income** from a trade or business conducted in a foreign country
- **Noncash income** (such as fair market value of property or the use of property)
- Cost-of-living allowances
- Overseas differentials
- Family allowances
- Moving expense reimbursements (to the extent includible in gross income)

### Earned Income Does NOT Include:

- **Dividends**
- **Interest**
- **Capital gains**
- **Rental income** (passive)
- **Pensions and annuities** (including Social Security benefits)
- **Gambling winnings**
- **Alimony**
- Pay received as a military or civilian employee of the U.S. government or its agencies
- Amounts received after the end of the tax year following the tax year in which the services were performed
- Meals and lodging excluded under IRC Section 119 (employer-provided for employer's convenience on employer's business premises)

### Employer-Provided Meals and Lodging (Section 119)

Meals and/or lodging provided by, or on behalf of, your employer that are excludable from your income under section 119 must have been provided for your employer's convenience and on your employer's business premises. For lodging, you must also have been required to accept the lodging as a condition of your employment. These amounts are **not** foreign earned income.

### Self-Employment Income Allocation

If both personal services and capital are material income-producing factors in your business, no more than **30%** of your share of the net profits of the business is considered earned income.

If capital is **not** a material income-producing factor and personal services produce the business income, the **entire** amount of net profits is considered earned income.

## Foreign Earned Income Exclusion (Part VII of Form 2555)

### Maximum Exclusion Amount

For 2025, the maximum exclusion is **$130,000**.

### Prorating for Partial-Year Qualification

If you qualify for fewer than a full year, the maximum exclusion is prorated:

**$130,000 / 365 days x number of qualifying days = your prorated maximum exclusion**

### Limiting the Exclusion

Your foreign earned income exclusion **cannot exceed** your foreign earned income for the tax year.

### Deductions Allocable to Excluded Income

If all of your foreign earned income is excluded, you **cannot** claim a credit or deduction for foreign taxes paid or accrued on that excluded income.

If only part of your income is excluded, you **cannot** claim a credit or deduction for the foreign taxes allocable to the excluded portion.

The exclusion amount will be reduced by the **pro rata share** of your expenses and self-employment tax deduction.

## Foreign Housing Exclusion and Housing Deduction (Parts VI, VIII, and IX)

### Overview

In addition to the foreign earned income exclusion, you can also exclude or deduct certain foreign housing amounts:

- **Housing Exclusion** (Part VIII): For employees (those receiving wages/salary)
- **Housing Deduction** (Part IX): For self-employed individuals

### Qualifying Housing Expenses INCLUDE:

- Rent
- Utilities (other than telephone charges)
- Real and personal property insurance
- Nonrefundable fees paid to obtain a lease
- Rental of furniture and accessories
- Residential parking
- Household repairs
- Occupancy taxes not deductible under IRC Section 164 or 216(a)

### Housing Expenses Do NOT Include:

- Lavish or extravagant expenses under the circumstances
- The cost of buying property (including mortgage principal)
- Purchased furniture or accessories
- Improvements and other expenses that increase the value or appreciably prolong the life of property
- The cost of domestic labor (maids, gardeners, etc.)
- Pay television subscriptions
- The value of meals
- Deductible interest and taxes
- The value of employer-provided lodging not included in gross income
- Depreciation on a house you own
- Amounts deductible by a tenant-stockholder in connection with cooperative housing

### Base Housing Amount (2025)

The **base housing amount** is **16%** of the maximum foreign earned income exclusion, prorated for the number of qualifying days:

- Full year: **$130,000 x 16% = $20,800**
- Partial year: **$20,800 / 365 x qualifying days**
- Daily rate: **$56.99 per qualifying day**

### Maximum Housing Expenses (Standard Limit)

The standard maximum housing expense limit is **30%** of the FEIE amount:

- Full year: **$130,000 x 30% = $39,000**
- Partial year: prorated by qualifying days

### High-Cost Locality Adjustments

The IRS publishes **Notice 2025-16**, which provides adjusted (higher) housing expense limits for specific high-cost foreign locations (e.g., Hong Kong, London, Tokyo, Singapore). If you lived in one of these designated high-cost areas, you may use the higher limit published for that city/country.

### Foreign Housing Amount Calculation

Your **foreign housing amount** = Total qualifying housing expenses - Base housing amount ($20,800 for full year)

This amount is then either:
- **Excluded** from income (if you are an employee), or
- **Deducted** from gross income (if you are self-employed)

### Housing Deduction for Self-Employed (Part IX)

If you are self-employed, your housing deduction **cannot exceed** your foreign earned income minus the sum of the foreign earned income exclusion plus the housing exclusion. Any excess housing deduction can be **carried forward** to the next tax year (but only to the next year).

## The Stacking Method: How Tax Is Computed with FEIE

### The Rule

When you claim the FEIE, the excluded income is removed from your taxable income, but the IRS uses a special method -- commonly called the **"stacking method"** or **"stacking rule"** -- to ensure your remaining taxable income is taxed at the **higher marginal rate** it would have been taxed at if you had not excluded any income.

### How It Works

You must use the **Foreign Earned Income Tax Worksheet** in the Instructions for Form 1040 to figure your tax on Form 1040 or 1040-SR, line 16. The worksheet operates as follows:

1. **Calculate tax on your total income** (as if no exclusion were claimed) -- i.e., tax on (taxable income + excluded foreign earned income + housing exclusion/deduction).
2. **Calculate tax on the excluded amount** alone (the excluded foreign earned income plus any housing exclusion/deduction), using the same tax rates and brackets.
3. **Subtract** the tax on the excluded amount from the tax on total income.
4. The **difference** is your income tax liability.

**Formula:**

```
Tax = Tax(Taxable Income + Excluded Amount) - Tax(Excluded Amount)
```

### Why This Matters

Without the stacking rule, excluding $130,000 of income would cause your remaining income to be taxed starting at the **lowest** brackets (10%, 12%, etc.). The stacking method ensures that the exclusion effectively removes the **bottom** of your income stack, and your remaining income is taxed at the **higher brackets** it would naturally fall into.

### Example

If a single taxpayer has $180,000 total income and excludes $130,000:
- Without stacking: $50,000 remaining taxed from the 10% bracket up
- With stacking: $50,000 remaining taxed as if it were the portion of income from $130,001 to $180,000 (the 22%-24% brackets)

---

## Self-Employment Tax: NOT Reduced by FEIE

### Critical Rule

The foreign earned income exclusion reduces your **regular income tax** liability, but it does **NOT** reduce your **self-employment tax**.

- Self-employment tax is computed on **Schedule SE** based on your **net self-employment earnings**, without regard to the FEIE.
- Even if you exclude all of your foreign earned income using Form 2555, you still owe **self-employment tax** (Social Security and Medicare taxes) on your net self-employment earnings.
- The self-employment tax rate is **15.3%** (12.4% Social Security + 2.9% Medicare) on net earnings up to the Social Security wage base, and **2.9%** Medicare on earnings above that amount.

### Self-Employment Tax Deduction

- The **deductible portion of self-employment tax** (the employer-equivalent half) reduces your adjusted gross income and factors into the FEIE calculation.
- The exclusion amount is reduced by the pro rata share of your expenses and self-employment tax deduction.

### Special Rules for Self-Employment Income on Form 2555

- If **all** of your foreign earned income (Part IV) is self-employment income, skip lines 34 and 35 and enter **zero** on line 36.
- The amount treated as earned income for housing purposes cannot be more than **30%** of your share of net profits from the trade or business after subtracting the deduction for the employer-equivalent portion of self-employment tax (applies when both capital and personal services are material income-producing factors).

## Choosing (Electing) the Exclusion

### Making the Election

You choose the foreign earned income exclusion and/or the foreign housing exclusion by completing the applicable parts of Form 2555 and attaching it to your Form 1040 or 1040-SR.

### Election Remains in Effect

Once you choose to claim the exclusion(s), that choice **remains in effect for that year and all future years** unless it is revoked.

### Revoking the Election

- To revoke your choice, you must attach a statement to your return for the first year you do not wish to claim the exclusion(s).
- If you revoke your choice, you **cannot** claim the exclusion(s) for your next **5 tax years** without the approval of the IRS.

### Interaction with Foreign Tax Credit

- Once you choose to exclude foreign earned income and/or foreign housing costs, you **cannot** take a foreign tax credit or deduction for taxes on income you excluded (or could have excluded).
- If you **do** take a credit or deduction for those taxes, your election(s) to exclude may be considered **revoked**.
- However, you **can** take a foreign tax credit on any foreign earned income that **exceeds** the excluded amounts.
