## 1. Overview

Publication 560 covers retirement plans available to self-employed individuals and small business owners: SEP-IRA, SIMPLE IRA, solo 401(k), defined benefit plans, and Keogh plans. Each plan type has distinct contribution limits, eligibility rules, and administrative requirements.

---

## 2. SEP-IRA (Simplified Employee Pension)

### 2.1 Contribution Limits

| Parameter | 2025 Limit |
|---|---|
| Maximum contribution | Lesser of **25%** of net SE income or **$70,000** |
| Compensation cap for employees | $350,000 |
| Employee elective deferrals | **Not permitted** (employer-only contributions) |

- **No employee elective deferrals.** All contributions are made by the employer (or the self-employed individual acting as employer). Employees cannot choose to defer salary into a SEP-IRA.
- The 25% rate applies to employee compensation. For self-employed individuals, the effective rate is lower due to the SE tax adjustment (see Section 7 below).

### 2.2 Contribution Deadline

SEP-IRA contributions may be made up to the **filing deadline of the tax return, including extensions**:
- For calendar-year filers: April 15, 2026, or October 15, 2026 if extended.
- A SEP plan can be **established and funded** as late as the extended filing deadline for the year contributions are first made.

### 2.3 Eligibility and Setup

- Any employer (including self-employed individuals) can establish a SEP.
- Must cover employees who are at least 21 years old, have worked for the employer in at least 3 of the last 5 years, and received at least $750 in compensation for 2025.
- Use **Form 5305-SEP** as the plan document (or a prototype plan from a financial institution).
- No annual IRS filing requirement unless plan assets exceed thresholds requiring Form 5500.

### 2.4 SECURE 2.0 -- Roth SEP Contributions

Beginning in 2023 (effective for plans that adopt this feature), employers may permit employees to designate SEP contributions as **Roth contributions**. Roth SEP contributions are included in the employee's gross income in the year of contribution but grow tax-free.

## 3. SIMPLE IRA (Savings Incentive Match Plan for Employees)

### 3.1 Employee Contribution Limits

| Parameter | 2025 Limit |
|---|---|
| Employee salary reduction (elective deferral) | **$16,500** |
| Catch-up contribution (age 50+) | **$3,500** |
| Enhanced catch-up (age 60--63, SECURE 2.0) | **$5,250** (150% of $3,500) |
| Total employee maximum (under 50) | $16,500 |
| Total employee maximum (age 50--59 or 64+) | $20,000 |
| Total employee maximum (age 60--63) | $21,750 |

> **Note:** For employers with **25 or fewer employees**, higher limits may apply under SECURE 2.0 Section 601 (10% increase to the base deferral limit). Consult IRS Notice 2024-80 for details.

### 3.2 Employer Contribution Requirements

The employer **must** make one of the following contributions:

1. **Matching contribution:** Dollar-for-dollar match of employee elective deferrals, up to **3%** of the employee's compensation. The match percentage can be reduced to as low as **1%** in any 2 out of 5 years.
2. **Nonelective contribution:** A flat **2%** of compensation for each eligible employee (whether or not the employee defers), up to the compensation cap of $350,000.

### 3.3 Key Rules

- Available to employers with **100 or fewer employees** who received at least $5,000 in compensation during the preceding year.
- Employer generally cannot maintain another qualified retirement plan.
- **No vesting schedule** -- all contributions are immediately 100% vested.
- Contributions are **tax-deductible** to the employer.
- The 2-year rule: Distributions within the first 2 years of participation are subject to a **25% early withdrawal penalty** (instead of the usual 10%).

### 3.4 SECURE 2.0 -- Roth SIMPLE Contributions

Employers may now offer a **Roth option** for SIMPLE IRA elective deferrals. Roth SIMPLE deferrals are included in the employee's current income but allow for tax-free qualified distributions.

---

## 4. Solo 401(k) (One-Participant 401(k) / Individual 401(k))

### 4.1 Contribution Limits

A solo 401(k) has two contribution components -- employee deferrals and employer profit-sharing:

| Component | 2025 Limit |
|---|---|
| Employee elective deferral | **$23,500** |
| Catch-up (age 50--59 or 64+) | **$7,500** |
| Enhanced catch-up (age 60--63) | **$11,250** |
| Employer profit-sharing contribution | Up to **25%** of net SE income (after SE tax deduction) |
| **Combined maximum** (under age 50) | **$70,000** |
| **Combined maximum** (age 50--59 or 64+) | **$77,500** |
| **Combined maximum** (age 60--63) | **$81,250** |

### 4.2 Roth Option

Solo 401(k) plans may include a **Roth 401(k)** feature. Employee elective deferrals can be designated as Roth contributions (after-tax, with tax-free qualified distributions). The employer profit-sharing portion is always pre-tax unless the plan adopts the SECURE 2.0 Roth employer contribution option.

### 4.3 Contribution Deadline

- **Employee deferrals:** Must be made by December 31, 2025 (end of the plan year).
- **Employer profit-sharing contributions:** May be made up to the filing deadline, including extensions (April 15, 2026, or October 15, 2026 if extended).

### 4.4 Eligibility and Filing Requirements

- Available to self-employed individuals or business owners with **no full-time employees** other than the owner (and spouse).
- No annual IRS filing unless plan assets exceed **$250,000** at year-end, in which case **Form 5500-EZ** is required.
- Loans from the plan are permitted (up to $50,000 or 50% of vested balance).

## 5. Defined Benefit Plans

### 5.1 Annual Benefit Limit

| Parameter | 2025 Limit |
|---|---|
| Maximum annual benefit at retirement | **$280,000** |
| Compensation cap for benefit calculations | $350,000 |

- A defined benefit plan promises a specified monthly or annual benefit at retirement, typically based on salary and years of service.
- The annual benefit cannot exceed the lesser of **100% of the participant's average compensation** for the highest 3 consecutive calendar years, or **$280,000** for 2025.
- Contributions are actuarially determined -- the employer contributes whatever amount is necessary to fund the promised benefit.

### 5.2 Key Features

- **Highest contribution potential** among all plan types -- annual contributions can significantly exceed $70,000 depending on the participant's age and benefit structure.
- Requires an enrolled actuary to determine annual contributions and certify the plan.
- More complex and costly to administer than defined contribution plans.
- Annual filing on **Form 5500** is required.
- Well-suited for high-income self-employed individuals over age 50 who want to maximize tax-deferred savings.

## 6. Keogh Plans (HR 10 Plans)

### 6.1 Overview

"Keogh plan" is the historical term for qualified retirement plans established by self-employed individuals or unincorporated businesses. The IRS no longer distinguishes Keogh plans from other qualified plans in current tax law -- the same rules apply to all qualified plans regardless of whether the employer is incorporated.

### 6.2 Types of Keogh Plans

1. **Defined contribution Keogh:** Functions identically to a profit-sharing or money purchase plan. Subject to the same $70,000 / 25% contribution limits as a solo 401(k) employer contribution.
2. **Defined benefit Keogh:** Functions identically to a defined benefit plan. Subject to the $280,000 annual benefit limit.

### 6.3 Key Considerations

- The term "Keogh" is largely archaic but still appears in tax literature and some plan documents.
- Same contribution limits, filing requirements, and distribution rules as their corporate equivalents.
- Self-employed individuals calculate contributions using net SE income (see Section 7).

---

## 7. Net Self-Employment Income Calculation

Self-employed individuals must use an adjusted income figure when calculating retirement plan contributions. The adjustment accounts for the self-employment tax deduction.

### 7.1 Step-by-Step Calculation

```
Step 1: Gross self-employment income (Schedule C net profit)

Step 2: Multiply by 0.9235 to get the Social Security tax base
         (equivalent to subtracting the "employer half" of SE tax)
         Adjusted SE income = Gross SE income x 0.9235

Step 3: Calculate the deductible portion of SE tax
         SE tax = Adjusted SE income x 0.153 (up to Social Security wage base)
         Deductible half = SE tax x 0.50

Step 4: Net SE income for retirement plan purposes
         = Step 2 result - Step 3 result (deductible half of SE tax)

Step 5: Apply the contribution percentage
         SEP-IRA: Net SE income x 25% (effective rate ~20% of gross)
         Solo 401(k) employer portion: Net SE income x 25%
```

### 7.2 Effective Rate for SEP-IRA

Because the contribution rate is applied to net SE income (which is already reduced), the effective contribution rate for a SEP-IRA is approximately **20%** of gross Schedule C net profit, not 25%.

| If Schedule C Net Profit Is | Approximate Maximum SEP Contribution |
|---|---|
| $50,000 | ~$9,176 |
| $100,000 | ~$18,587 |
| $200,000 | ~$37,881 |
| $350,000+ | $70,000 (cap) |

### 7.3 Where the 0.9235 Factor Comes From

The 0.9235 multiplier equals `1 - (0.5 x 0.153)`, which is `1 - 0.0765 = 0.9235`. This reflects the fact that self-employed individuals can deduct 50% of their self-employment tax (the "employer-equivalent" portion). The IRS requires this adjustment before calculating the contribution rate to avoid a circular calculation.

### 7.4 IRS Rate Table (Self-Employed)

For self-employed individuals, the IRS provides a rate table in Publication 560 that converts the plan contribution rate to the effective self-employed rate:

| Plan Contribution Rate | Self-Employed Rate |
|---|---|
| 25% | 20% (0.200000) |
| 20% | 16.6667% (0.166667) |
| 15% | 13.0435% (0.130435) |
| 10% | 9.0909% (0.090909) |

- Self-employed individuals deduct SEP and qualified plan contributions on **Schedule 1, Line 16** (self-employed SEP, SIMPLE, and qualified plans).
- Contributions reduce income tax but do **not** reduce self-employment tax.
- Distributions are taxed as ordinary income (except Roth qualified distributions).
- Early distributions (before age 59 1/2) are generally subject to a **10% penalty** (25% for SIMPLE IRA within first 2 years).
