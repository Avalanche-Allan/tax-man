Source: https://www.irs.gov/instructions/i1040sca

---

## General Information

Schedule A (Form 1040) is used to figure itemized deductions. In most cases, federal income tax will be less if the taxpayer takes the larger of their itemized deductions or the standard deduction. Taxpayers should itemize deductions if total itemized deductions exceed the applicable standard deduction amount.

### Who Should Itemize

Itemize deductions on Schedule A if:
- Total itemized deductions exceed the standard deduction
- The taxpayer cannot use the standard deduction (e.g., married filing separately and spouse itemizes)
- The taxpayer is a nonresident or dual-status alien during the year (unless married to a U.S. citizen or resident alien who elects to be treated as a U.S. resident)

### Standard Deduction Amounts (2025)

| Filing Status | Standard Deduction |
|---|---|
| Single | $15,000 |
| Married Filing Jointly / Surviving Spouse | $30,000 |
| Married Filing Separately | $15,000 |
| Head of Household | $22,500 |

**Additional Standard Deduction (Age 65+ or Blind):**
- Single or Head of Household: $2,000 per qualifying condition
- Married Filing Jointly/Separately: $1,600 per qualifying condition per spouse

**OBBBA Senior Bonus Deduction (2025-2028):**
- Additional $6,000 deduction for individuals age 65+; $12,000 if both spouses qualify on a joint return
- Phases out for MAGI over $75,000 ($150,000 MFJ)
- Claimed on Schedule 1-A, not Schedule A; supplements but does not replace the existing additional standard deduction

> **Note:** Compare total itemized deductions (Schedule A, line 17) to the standard deduction. Use whichever is greater, unless the taxpayer must itemize.

## Part I: Medical and Dental Expenses (Lines 1-4)

### Line 1 - Medical and Dental Expenses

Enter the total amount paid in 2025 for medical and dental expenses for the taxpayer, spouse, and dependents. Qualifying expenses include amounts paid for:

**Qualifying Medical Expenses:**
- Diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease
- Prescription medications and insulin
- Health insurance premiums (medical, dental, Medicare Part B, Part D, Medicare Advantage, Medigap)
- Qualified long-term care insurance premiums (subject to age-based limits)
- Medical equipment (eyeglasses, hearing aids, crutches, wheelchairs, guide dogs)
- Laboratory fees, X-rays, and diagnostic tests
- Hospital services, nursing services, ambulance costs
- Dental treatment (fillings, braces, dentures, extractions)
- Mental health care (psychiatrist, psychologist, therapy)
- Transportation essential to medical care (mileage rate: 22 cents per mile for 2025)
- Lodging away from home for medical care (up to $50 per night per person)

**Non-Qualifying Expenses (Do NOT Include):**
- Cosmetic surgery (unless necessary due to congenital abnormality, injury, or disfiguring disease)
- Over-the-counter medicines (unless prescribed)
- General health items (toothpaste, toiletries, gym memberships unless prescribed)
- Funeral or burial expenses
- Premiums for life insurance, disability income insurance
- Amounts paid by insurance or other sources (reimbursements)

**Insurance Premium Rules:**
- Do NOT include premiums paid with pre-tax dollars through an employer cafeteria plan (excluded from box 1 of W-2)
- If the taxpayer claimed the self-employed health insurance deduction on Schedule 1, line 17, reduce premiums by that amount
- Do NOT include premiums for policies that pay a fixed amount per day of hospitalization or policies that pay for loss of earnings

**Who Qualifies:**
Expenses can be included for anyone who was one of the following when services were provided or when payment was made:
- The taxpayer or spouse
- A dependent claimed on the return
- A person who would have been a dependent except that the person filed a joint return, had gross income of $5,150 or more, or could be claimed as a dependent on someone else's return

### Line 2 - AGI Amount
Enter the amount from Form 1040, line 11 (adjusted gross income).

### Line 3 - 7.5% of AGI
Multiply line 2 by 0.075 (7.5%).

### Line 4 - Deductible Medical Expenses
Subtract line 3 from line 1. If the result is zero or less, enter zero. Only the amount exceeding 7.5% of AGI is deductible.

**Example:** If AGI is $100,000 and medical expenses total $10,000:
- 7.5% of $100,000 = $7,500
- Deductible amount = $10,000 - $7,500 = $2,500

> **Reference:** See Publication 502 for a comprehensive list of qualifying medical and dental expenses.

## Part II: Taxes You Paid (Lines 5-7)

### SALT Deduction Cap (State and Local Taxes)

Under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA), P.L. 119-21, the combined deduction for state and local taxes is capped as follows:

| Filing Status | SALT Cap (2025) |
|---|---|
| Single | $40,000 |
| Married Filing Jointly | $40,000 |
| Head of Household | $40,000 |
| Married Filing Separately | $20,000 |

**MAGI-Based Phaseout (Income Limitation):**
The increased SALT cap phases down for higher-income taxpayers:

| Filing Status | Phaseout Begins | Fully Phased Out (Floor = $10,000/$5,000 MFS) |
|---|---|---|
| Single | $500,000 MAGI | $600,000 MAGI |
| Married Filing Jointly | $500,000 MAGI | $600,000 MAGI |
| Married Filing Separately | $250,000 MAGI | $300,000 MAGI |

**Phaseout Calculation:**
The $40,000 cap is reduced by 30% of MAGI exceeding the threshold. The cap cannot fall below $10,000 ($5,000 MFS).

Formula: Allowed SALT = $40,000 - [0.30 x (MAGI - $500,000)]
- Minimum: $10,000 ($5,000 MFS)

**Example (MFJ, MAGI = $550,000):**
- Excess MAGI: $550,000 - $500,000 = $50,000
- Reduction: $50,000 x 0.30 = $15,000
- Allowed SALT cap: $40,000 - $15,000 = $25,000

**Future Year Adjustments:**
- 2026: Cap = $40,400; phaseout begins at $505,000 (1% annual increase)
- 2027: Cap = $40,800; phaseout begins at $510,050
- 2028: Cap = $41,200; phaseout begins at $515,150
- 2029: Cap = $41,600; phaseout begins at $520,302
- 2030: Cap reverts to $10,000 ($5,000 MFS); no phaseout

- Under OBBBA, beginning in 2026, a new limitation caps the gambling loss deduction at 90% of gambling winnings (does not apply for 2025)

**Federal Estate Tax on Income in Respect of a Decedent (IRD):**

**Amortizable Bond Premium:**
- Deduction for amortizable bond premium on taxable bonds

**Impairment-Related Work Expenses:**
- Business expenses of individuals with physical or mental disabilities that are necessary for the individual to work

**No Pease Limitation (2018-2025):**

---

## Standard Deduction vs. Itemized Deductions Decision Rules

### Compare and Choose

1. Calculate total itemized deductions on Schedule A, line 17
2. Determine the applicable standard deduction (including any additional amounts for age 65+ or blindness)
3. Use the LARGER amount to reduce taxable income
4. If itemized deductions exceed the standard deduction, file Schedule A

### Must Itemize If:
- Married filing separately (MFS) and the spouse itemizes deductions -- both spouses must use the same method
- Filing a short-year return due to a change in annual accounting period
- A nonresident or dual-status alien (and not electing to be treated as a U.S. resident for the entire year)

### Cannot Use Standard Deduction If:
- Married filing separately and spouse itemizes
- Nonresident alien or dual-status alien (without election)
- Filing a return for a period less than 12 months due to a change in accounting period
- An estate or trust, common trust fund, or partnership (reported on other forms)

### Planning Considerations:
- **Bunching Strategy:** Taxpayers near the standard deduction threshold may benefit from "bunching" deductible expenses (e.g., charitable contributions, property tax payments) into alternating years to exceed the standard deduction in one year and take the standard deduction in the other
- **State Impact:** Itemizing on the federal return may affect the state return calculation; some states require itemizing if the federal return itemizes, while others allow separate elections
- **AMT Interaction:** State and local taxes are not deductible for Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) purposes; medical expenses use a 7.5% AGI floor for both regular tax and AMT

---

## OBBBA Changes Affecting Itemized Deductions (2025)

### New Schedule 1-A Deductions (Not on Schedule A)

> These deductions are available regardless of whether the taxpayer itemizes or takes the standard deduction.

### SALT Cap Increase
