Source: https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-form-1040-es

---

## General Information

Form 1040-ES is used by individuals to figure and pay estimated tax. Estimated tax is the method used to pay income tax on earnings that are not subject to withholding, including self-employment income, interest, dividends, rents, capital gains, alimony, and other income. It may also be required when withholding from wages, pensions, or other income is insufficient to cover the total tax liability.

Estimated tax payments cover both income tax and self-employment tax, as well as any alternative minimum tax (AMT) owed.

## Who Must Pay Estimated Tax

You must make estimated tax payments if **both** of the following conditions apply:

1. You expect to owe at least **$1,000** in tax for 2025, after subtracting withholding and refundable credits
2. You expect your withholding and refundable credits to be less than the **smaller** of:
   - **90%** of the tax shown on your 2025 return, **or**
   - **100%** of the tax shown on your 2024 return (the return must cover all 12 months)
   - If your 2024 AGI exceeded **$150,000** ($75,000 if married filing separately), substitute **110%** for 100%

### Common Situations Requiring Estimated Payments

- Self-employed individuals (sole proprietors, independent contractors, freelancers)
- Partners and S corporation shareholders receiving Schedule K-1 income
- Investors with significant dividends, capital gains, or interest income
- Landlords with rental income
- Retirees with pension/IRA distributions not fully covered by withholding
- Employees who have not adjusted their W-4 withholding sufficiently
- Recipients of gambling winnings, prizes, or awards

### Who Does NOT Need to Pay

- If you expect your total tax (after withholding and credits) to be less than $1,000
- If your withholding plus credits will equal at least 90% of current year tax or 100%/110% of prior year tax
- U.S. citizens or residents who had no tax liability for the full 12-month prior tax year

## Quarterly Due Dates (2025 Tax Year)

Estimated tax is paid in four installments. Each payment covers income earned during the period shown:

| Payment | Income Period | Due Date |
|---|---|---|
| 1st Quarter | January 1 -- March 31 | **April 15, 2025** |
| 2nd Quarter | April 1 -- May 31 | **June 16, 2025** |
| 3rd Quarter | June 1 -- August 31 | **September 15, 2025** |
| 4th Quarter | September 1 -- December 31 | **January 15, 2026** |

> **Note:** If a due date falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, the payment is due on the next business day. The June date is the 16th (not the 15th) because June 15 falls on a Sunday in 2025.

> **Tip:** You can skip the 4th quarter payment (January 15) if you file your 2025 return and pay all tax owed by **January 31, 2026**.

### Unequal Payment Periods

The quarters are not equal in length. Q2 covers only 2 months while Q3 covers 3 months. Taxpayers with seasonal or irregular income should be aware of this when computing required payments.

## Estimated Tax Worksheet Walkthrough

Form 1040-ES includes a worksheet to compute the required annual estimated tax payment. The worksheet parallels a simplified Form 1040.

### Line-by-Line Summary

| Line | Description | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **1** | Expected AGI for 2025 | Include all income sources: wages, self-employment, dividends, capital gains, rental, etc. Use prior year as starting point and adjust for expected changes |
| **2** | Deductions | If itemizing: expected Schedule A total. If not: standard deduction ($15,000 single, $30,000 MFJ, $22,500 HOH). Include qualified business income (QBI) deduction if applicable |
| **3** | Taxable income | Line 1 minus line 2 (not less than zero) |
| **4** | Income tax | Compute using the 2025 Tax Rate Schedule (included in Form 1040-ES) on the amount from line 3 |
| **5** | AMT | If you expect to owe AMT (Form 6251), enter the expected amount |
| **6** | Total tax before credits | Add lines 4 and 5, plus any other taxes (e.g., self-employment tax from line 9, additional Medicare tax, NIIT) |
| **7** | Credits | Enter expected nonrefundable credits: child tax credit (Schedule 8812), education credits, foreign tax credit, etc. |
| **8** | Tax after credits | Line 6 minus line 7 |
| **9** | Self-employment tax | Compute using the Self-Employment Tax and Deduction Worksheet (included in Form 1040-ES). Rate is 15.3% on first $176,100 of SE earnings (12.4% Social Security + 2.9% Medicare), plus 2.9% Medicare on amounts above that |
| **10** | Other taxes | Additional Medicare tax (0.9% on wages + SE income over $200,000 single / $250,000 MFJ), net investment income tax (3.8%), household employment tax, etc. |
| **11a** | Total expected tax | Sum of lines 8, 9, and 10 |
| **11b** | Refundable credits | Earned income credit, additional child tax credit, American opportunity credit (refundable portion), net premium tax credit |
| **11c** | Total tax after refundable credits | Line 11a minus line 11b |
| **12a** | Required annual payment (current year method) | Multiply line 11c by **90%** |
| **12b** | Required annual payment (prior year method) | Enter **100%** of 2024 tax (or **110%** if 2024 AGI exceeded $150,000 / $75,000 MFS) |
| **13** | Required annual payment | **Smaller** of line 12a or 12b |
| **14a** | Expected withholding for 2025 | Income tax withheld from wages (W-4), pensions, etc. |
| **14b** | Subtract withholding from required payment | Line 13 minus line 14a |
| **15** | Quarterly payment amount | Divide line 14b by 4. This is each quarterly estimated payment |

> **Key Decision:** If line 11c minus line 14a is less than $1,000, you are not required to make estimated payments.

## Safe Harbor Rules

The safe harbor rules protect you from underpayment penalties even if your actual tax liability exceeds your estimated payments. You satisfy the safe harbor if your total estimated payments plus withholding equal or exceed **the lesser of**:

### Rule 1: Current-Year Safe Harbor (90% Rule)

Pay at least **90%** of your current tax year liability through withholding and estimated payments.

### Rule 2: Prior-Year Safe Harbor (100% / 110% Rule)

Pay at least **100%** of your prior year's total tax liability. This is the most common safe harbor because it can be computed with certainty based on your filed return.

**High-Income Exception:** If your prior year AGI exceeded **$150,000** ($75,000 if married filing separately), you must pay **110%** of prior year tax to satisfy the prior-year safe harbor.

| Prior Year AGI | Safe Harbor % of Prior Year Tax |
|---|---|
| $150,000 or less ($75,000 MFS) | 100% |
| Over $150,000 ($75,000 MFS) | 110% |

### $1,000 De Minimis Rule

If you expect to owe **less than $1,000** in tax after subtracting withholding and refundable credits, you are not required to make estimated tax payments and will not owe a penalty regardless of how much you paid in.

### Practical Application

| Scenario | Strategy |
|---|---|
| Stable income year to year | Use prior-year safe harbor (100%/110%) for simplicity |
| Income expected to decrease | Use current-year method (90%) to avoid overpaying |
| Income expected to increase significantly | Prior-year safe harbor (100%/110%) protects against penalty even if current-year tax is much higher |
| Variable/unpredictable income | Use prior-year safe harbor or annualized installment method |

> **Important:** The safe harbor protects only against the **underpayment penalty**. You still owe the full tax due when you file your return. Interest does not accrue on the underpayment if you meet the safe harbor, but the balance is due with the return.

## Annualized Installment Method

If your income is not received evenly throughout the year (e.g., a large capital gain in Q4, seasonal business, bonus income), you can use the **annualized installment method** to potentially reduce or eliminate earlier quarterly payments.

### How It Works

- Instead of dividing the annual required payment into four equal installments, you compute the required payment for each quarter based on the income actually received through that quarter
- Each quarter's income is "annualized" (projected to a full-year amount), and the tax is computed on that annualized amount
- Required cumulative payments are: 22.5% (Q1), 45% (Q2), 67.5% (Q3), 90% (Q4) of the annualized tax

### When to Use

- You received most of your income in later quarters (e.g., year-end bonus, Q4 capital gain)
- Your income varies substantially by quarter (seasonal business)
- You want to avoid paying large estimated payments early in the year based on income you have not yet earned

### How to Claim

- Use **Schedule AI** (Annualized Income Installment Method) of **Form 2210** to compute annualized installments
- Attach Form 2210 with Schedule AI to your return to demonstrate you do not owe a penalty (or owe a reduced penalty)

> **Example:** A taxpayer earns $50,000 in wages (spread evenly) and realizes a $200,000 capital gain in November. Without the annualized method, the required Q1-Q3 payments would be based on the full $250,000 annual income. With the annualized method, Q1-Q3 payments are based only on the wage income, and the large Q4 payment covers the capital gain.

## Payment Methods

The IRS offers multiple ways to make estimated tax payments:

### Electronic Payments (Preferred)

| Method | Details |
|---|---|
| **IRS Direct Pay** | Free bank account transfer via irs.gov/directpay. Available 24/7. Provides immediate confirmation |
| **EFTPS** | Electronic Federal Tax Payment System (eftps.gov). Free. Requires enrollment. Allows scheduling of all four payments in advance. Provides payment history and confirmation numbers |
| **IRS Online Account** | Pay through your IRS online account at irs.gov/account. View payment history and balances |
| **IRS2Go App** | Mobile app for making payments from your phone or tablet |
| **Credit/Debit Card** | Pay through IRS-approved third-party processors. **Convenience fees apply** (credit cards: ~1.85-1.98%; debit cards: flat fee ~$2.20) |
| **Digital Wallet** | PayPal, Click to Pay, and other options through third-party processors |

### Paper Payments

| Method | Details |
|---|---|
| **Check or Money Order** | Mail with the appropriate Form 1040-ES payment voucher. Make payable to "United States Treasury." Write your SSN and "2025 Form 1040-ES" on the payment. Mail to the IRS address specified for your state |

> **Tip:** Electronic payments are strongly preferred. They provide immediate confirmation, avoid mail delays, and reduce errors. EFTPS is especially useful for scheduling all four quarterly payments at the beginning of the year.

### Applying an Overpayment

If you overpaid your prior year tax, you can elect to apply the overpayment to your estimated tax for the current year. This is indicated on your prior year return (Form 1040, line 36). The overpayment is applied to your first required installment.

## Penalty Avoidance Strategies

### Key Strategies

1. **Use the prior-year safe harbor:** Pay 100% (or 110% if high-income) of your prior year tax through withholding and estimated payments. This is the simplest approach because the target amount is known with certainty
2. **Increase W-4 withholding:** If you have wage income, increasing your W-4 withholding can substitute for or supplement estimated payments. Withholding is treated as paid evenly throughout the year, even if the additional withholding occurs late in the year -- this is a significant advantage over estimated payments
3. **Make timely quarterly payments:** Even if you use the current-year method, ensure each quarter's payment is at least 25% of the required annual amount
4. **Use the annualized installment method** if income is uneven, to reduce early-quarter payment requirements
5. **Monitor throughout the year:** Review your estimated tax situation at each quarterly due date and adjust payments as needed

> **W-4 Strategy:** Because withholding is deemed paid ratably over the year regardless of when it is actually withheld, a taxpayer who realizes in Q4 that they have underpaid estimated taxes can increase W-4 withholding in Q4 to make up the shortfall. The additional withholding will be treated as if it were paid evenly across all four quarters, potentially eliminating the underpayment penalty for earlier quarters.

## Form 2210: Underpayment of Estimated Tax

Form 2210 is used to determine whether you owe a penalty for underpayment of estimated tax and, if so, to compute the penalty amount. In many cases, the IRS will compute the penalty for you; however, you may want to file Form 2210 to use the annualized installment method or to request a waiver.

### When the Penalty Applies

An underpayment penalty may apply if:

- You did not pay enough estimated tax for any quarter
- You did not pay estimated tax on time
- Your total payments (withholding + estimated payments) were less than the required annual payment

### Penalty Computation

- The penalty is essentially **interest** on the underpayment amount for the period of underpayment
- The IRS sets the interest rate quarterly, based on the federal short-term rate plus 3 percentage points (approximately **8%** annually as of 2025)
- The penalty is computed separately for each quarter, based on the underpayment amount and the number of days from the due date to the payment date (or April 15 of the following year, whichever is earlier)

### Exceptions to the Penalty

No penalty is owed if any of the following apply:

| Exception | Details |
|---|---|
| **De minimis** | Total tax after withholding and credits is less than $1,000 |
| **Prior-year safe harbor** | Total payments equal or exceed 100% of prior year tax (110% if prior-year AGI > $150,000) |
| **Current-year safe harbor** | Total payments equal or exceed 90% of current year tax |
| **No prior-year liability** | You had no tax liability for the prior tax year (full 12-month year, U.S. citizen/resident) |

### Penalty Waiver

The IRS may waive all or part of the penalty if:

- You retired (after age 62) or became disabled in 2024 or 2025 and the underpayment was due to reasonable cause
- The underpayment was due to a **casualty, disaster, or other unusual circumstance** and it would be inequitable to impose the penalty
- You are located in a **federally declared disaster area** -- the IRS automatically applies penalty relief by county; generally do not file Form 2210 in this case

To request a waiver, check Box B on Form 2210, complete the form through line 18, enter the amount you want waived in parentheses on the dotted line next to line 19, and attach a statement explaining why you could not meet the estimated tax requirements.

### Form 2210 Filing Decision

| Situation | Action |
|---|---|
| You meet a safe harbor or exception | Generally do not need to file Form 2210 |
| IRS sends a penalty notice but you believe you qualify for an exception | File Form 2210 to demonstrate the exception |
| You want to use the annualized installment method | File Form 2210 with Schedule AI |
| You want to request a waiver | File Form 2210 with a statement |
| The IRS can figure the penalty and you do not dispute it | Let the IRS compute the penalty; they will send a bill |

### Special Rules

**Farmers and Fishermen:** If at least two-thirds of your gross income for 2024 or 2025 is from farming or fishing, substitute **66 2/3%** for 90% in the current-year safe harbor. You may also make a single estimated payment by January 15 (instead of quarterly payments) and file your return by March 1 to avoid the penalty entirely.

**Fiscal Year Taxpayers:** Adjust all due dates to correspond to the 15th day of the 4th, 6th, and 9th months of the fiscal year, and the 1st month of the following fiscal year.
