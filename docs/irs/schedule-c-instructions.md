---

## General Information

### Purpose of Form
Use Schedule C (Form 1040) to report income or loss from a business you operated or a profession you practiced as a sole proprietor. An activity qualifies as a business if your primary purpose for engaging in the activity is for income or profit and you are involved in the activity with continuity and regularity.

### Who Must File
You must file Schedule C if you:
- Operated a business or practiced a profession as a sole proprietor
- Are a single-member Limited Liability Company (LLC) that is not treated as a corporation
- Are a statutory employee (income reported on Form W-2 with the "Statutory employee" box checked)
- Earned $400 or more in net self-employment income

A single-member LLC is generally not treated as a separate entity for federal income tax purposes and reports on Schedule C.

If your sole proprietorship has no profit or loss during the full year, it is not necessary to file a Schedule C. However, if your business is inactive and you receive payments (such as insurance) that relate to the business, you must report those payments on Schedule C.

### Income Reporting Forms
- **Form 1099-NEC**: Nonemployee compensation -- report on Schedule C
- **Form 1099-K**: Payment card and third-party network transactions -- report on Schedule C
- **Form 1099-MISC**: Miscellaneous income (rent, royalties, prizes, awards, etc.)

You must report all income you receive on your tax return, including gross payment amounts on Form 1099-K and amounts on other reporting documents.

### Principal Business or Professional Activity Code
Enter the six-digit code from the list of Principal Business or Professional Activity Codes (based on NAICS - North American Industry Classification System). This identifies the type of business activity that generates the primary source of your income.

### Separate Businesses
If you have more than one business activity, file a separate Schedule C for each business.

## Accounting Methods

### Cash Method
Under the cash method, you report income in the year you actually or constructively receive it and deduct expenses in the year you actually pay them. Most small businesses use the cash method because it is simpler.

### Accrual Method
Under the accrual method, you report income when you earn it (even if not yet received) and deduct expenses when you incur them (even if not yet paid).

### Changing Your Accounting Method
You must use the same accounting method from year to year. If this is your first year of business, you may choose your method. To change your accounting method after the first year, you must file **Form 3115, Application for Change in Accounting Method**. A Section 481(a) adjustment may be required, which spreads the income impact over several years (up to four).

---

## Material Participation

You materially participated in a trade or business activity for the tax year if you meet any one of the following seven tests:

### Test 1 -- 500-Hour Test
You participated in the activity for more than 500 hours during the tax year.

### Test 2 -- Substantially All Participation Test
Your participation in the activity for the tax year was substantially all of the participation in the activity of all individuals (including individuals who did not own any interest in the activity) for the tax year.

### Test 3 -- 100-Hour / More Than Others Test
You participated in the activity for more than 100 hours during the tax year, and you participated at least as much as any other individual (including individuals who did not own any interest in the activity) for the tax year.

### Test 4 -- Significant Participation Activities Test
The activity is a significant participation activity for the tax year, and you participated in all significant participation activities for more than 500 hours during the year. An activity is a "significant participation activity" if it involves the conduct of a trade or business, you participated in the activity for more than 100 hours during the tax year, and you did not materially participate under any of the other material participation tests.

### Test 5 -- Prior-Year Participation Test
You materially participated in the activity for any 5 of the prior 10 tax years.

### Test 6 -- Personal Service Activity Test
The activity is a personal service activity in which you materially participated for any 3 prior tax years. A personal service activity is an activity that involves performing personal services in the fields of health, law, engineering, architecture, accounting, actuarial science, performing arts, consulting, or any other trade or business in which capital is not a material income-producing factor.

### Test 7 -- Facts and Circumstances Test
Based on all the facts and circumstances, you participated in the activity on a regular, continuous, and substantial basis during the tax year. Your participation in managing the activity does not count in determining whether you meet this test if:
- Any person (except you) received compensation for performing management services in connection with the activity, or
- Any individual spent more hours during the tax year than you spent performing management services in connection with the activity (regardless of whether that individual was compensated)

### What Counts as Participation
For purposes of the seven material participation tests, participation generally includes any work you did in connection with an activity if you owned an interest in the activity at the time you did the work. Work done as an investor does not count as participation unless you were directly involved in the day-to-day management or operations of the activity.

### Passive Activity Rules
If you did not materially participate in the activity, the income or loss from the activity is passive. Passive activity losses can generally only offset passive activity income. Use **Form 8582, Passive Activity Loss Limitations** to figure allowable passive losses.

## Part I -- Income (Lines 1-7)

### Line 1 -- Gross Receipts or Sales
Enter gross receipts from your trade or business. Be sure to report all income attributable to your trade or business from all sources. Check the box on line 1 if this income was reported to you on Form W-2 and the "Statutory employee" box on that form was checked.

- Repairs and maintenance
- Insurance
- License plates and registration fees
- Tires
- Garage rent
- Tolls and parking fees
- Depreciation (or lease payments)

**Important**: You cannot deduct commuting expenses (driving from home to your regular workplace). If you use your vehicle for both business and personal purposes, you must divide your expenses based on actual mileage.

### Line 10 -- Commissions and Fees

- Allows you to expense the cost of qualifying business property in the year placed in service instead of depreciating over time

### Line 16b -- Interest (Other)
Enter other business interest payments for which you did not receive a Form 1098. This includes:
- Interest on business loans
- Interest on business credit cards
- Interest on installment purchases of business equipment

- Cleaning supplies
- Small tools

**Tax home**: In most cases, your tax home is your main place of business, regardless of where you maintain your family home.

Deductible travel expenses include:

- Taxi, rideshare, and shuttle fares
- Lodging (hotels, motels)
- Dry cleaning and laundry while traveling

### Line 24b -- Deductible Meals (50% Limitation)
Enter your deductible business meal expenses. Include meals while traveling away from home for business.

#### The 50% Rule
In most cases, you can deduct only **50%** of your business meal expenses, including meals incurred while away from home on business.

**How to calculate**: Enter the total amount of meal expenses, then multiply by 50%. Enter the result on line 24b.

#### DOT Hours of Service Exception
For individuals subject to the Department of Transportation (DOT) hours of service limits, the percentage is increased to **80%** for business meals consumed during or incident to any period of duty for which those limits are in effect.

#### Standard Meal Allowance
Instead of deducting the actual cost of your meals while traveling, you can use the **standard meal allowance** (per diem rates). Under this method, you deduct a specified amount depending on where you travel, instead of keeping records of actual meal expenses. However, you must still keep records to prove the time, place, and business purpose of your travel.

#### Meals That Are 100% Deductible (Special Cases)
- Meals whose value is included in an employee's compensation
- Meals provided to employees for the employer's convenience on the employer's premises (limited)

- Commissions paid to employees

**Do not** include:

If you claimed employment-related credits (such as the Work Opportunity Credit), reduce the wages reported on this line by the amount of those credits.

### Line 27a -- Other Expenses (from Line 48)
Enter the total from Part V, line 48. This is the total of other business expenses that do not fit into any of the categories on lines 8-26.

### Line 27b -- Reserved for Future Use

---

## Lines 28-31 -- Net Profit or Loss Calculation

### Line 28 -- Total Expenses Before Expenses for Business Use of Home
Add lines 8 through 27a. This is your total business expenses before the home office deduction.

### Line 29 -- Tentative Profit (or Loss)
Subtract line 28 from line 7. This gives you your tentative profit or loss before the home office deduction.

### Line 30 -- Expenses for Business Use of Your Home
Enter the allowable expenses for the business use of your home. You have two options:

#### Option 1: Regular Method (Form 8829)
Complete **Form 8829, Expenses for Business Use of Your Home** to calculate the deduction. This method allows you to deduct actual expenses including:
- Mortgage interest (business portion)
- Real estate taxes (business portion)
- Insurance (business portion)
- Utilities (business portion)
- Repairs and maintenance (business portion)
- Depreciation of home (business portion)
- Rent (if renting, business portion)

The business percentage is calculated by dividing the area of your home used for business by the total area of your home, or by dividing the number of rooms used for business by the total number of rooms (if rooms are approximately equal in size).

**Requirements**:
- The space must be used **regularly and exclusively** for business
- Must be your principal place of business, or a place where you meet or deal with patients, clients, or customers in the normal course of business

#### Option 2: Simplified Method
The simplified method is an alternative to calculating, allocating, and substantiating actual expenses.

- **Rate**: $5 per square foot
- **Maximum area**: 300 square feet
- **Maximum deduction**: $1,500 per year ($5 x 300 sq ft)
- **Do not** use Form 8829 if using the simplified method
- When you use the simplified method, you cannot deduct depreciation or section 179 expenses for the home office space
- If you operate more than one business qualifying for the deduction, you are limited to a maximum of 300 square feet total for all businesses
- You must allocate the actual square footage used among your qualified businesses

**Limitation**: The home office deduction cannot exceed your gross income from the business minus all other business expenses. If your business deductions (not including home office) are equal to or greater than your gross income from the business, you may not claim the home office deduction (it cannot create or increase a loss).

**Important**: Do not report home office expenses elsewhere on Schedule C. All home office expenses are reported on line 30 only.

### Line 31 -- Net Profit or (Loss)
Subtract line 30 from line 29. This is your net profit or loss from the business.

#### If You Have a Net Profit
- Enter the profit on **Schedule 1 (Form 1040), line 3**
- Also enter on **Schedule SE, line 2** (to calculate self-employment tax)
- You may be eligible for the **Qualified Business Income (QBI) deduction** of up to 20% using **Form 8995** or **Form 8995-A**

#### If You Have a Net Loss
- You may need to complete **Form 8582** (Passive Activity Loss Limitations) if you did not materially participate in the business
- Check the box on line 31 that describes your investment in this activity:
  - **Box 32a**: If all investment is at risk
  - **Box 32b**: If some investment is not at risk
- **At-risk rules** limit your deductible loss to the amount you have at risk in the activity (your own money, certain personal loans, and amounts you are personally liable for)
- **Excess business loss limitation**: After applying the at-risk rules and passive activity rules, losses may be further limited. Complete **Form 461, Limitation on Business Losses** to figure the excess business loss amount

#### Flow to Other Forms
The net profit or loss from Schedule C flows to:
1. **Schedule 1 (Form 1040), line 3** -- Business income or loss
2. **Schedule SE** -- Self-employment tax calculation (net earnings from self-employment)
3. **Form 8995 or 8995-A** -- Qualified business income deduction (QBI starts with Schedule C line 31 and is reduced by deductible self-employment tax, self-employed health insurance, and qualified plan contributions)

---

## Part III -- Cost of Goods Sold (Lines 33-42)

Complete this section only if you sell products or merchandise, use raw materials or supplies, or use subcontractors to generate income.

### Line 33 -- Method(s) Used to Value Closing Inventory
Check the applicable box:
- **a. Cost** -- Value inventory at its actual cost
- **b. Lower of cost or market** -- Value inventory at the lower of its cost or its current market value (cannot be used with LIFO)
- **c. Other** -- Attach explanation. Must be a method approved by the IRS

**Note**: If you are using the cash method of accounting, you are required to use the cost method to value inventory.

### Line 34 -- Was There Any Change in Determining Quantities, Costs, or Valuations?
If "Yes," attach a detailed explanation. Changes in inventory valuation methods require IRS consent through filing **Form 3115**.

### Line 35 -- Inventory at Beginning of Year
Enter the value of inventory on hand at the beginning of the tax year. This amount **must match** the ending inventory reported on your prior year's Schedule C (line 41). Any discrepancies require a formal explanation and may trigger an IRS inquiry.

### Line 36 -- Purchases Less Cost of Items Withdrawn for Personal Use
Enter the cost of all merchandise, raw materials, and goods purchased for resale during the tax year. This figure must include all necessary costs to bring the goods to the business location and make them ready for sale, including:
- Freight-in
- Trucking costs
- Other transportation fees

Subtract the cost of any items you withdrew from inventory for personal use.

### Line 37 -- Cost of Labor

### Line 38 -- Materials and Supplies
Enter the cost of materials and supplies used in manufacturing or production of goods.

### Line 39 -- Other Costs

### Line 40 -- Total (Add Lines 35 through 39)

### Line 41 -- Inventory at End of Year
Enter the value of inventory on hand at the end of the tax year, valued using the method indicated on line 33.

### Line 42 -- Cost of Goods Sold
Subtract line 41 from line 40. Enter the result here and on **line 4, Part I**.

### Inventory Valuation Methods

#### FIFO (First-In, First-Out)
Assumes the oldest inventory items are sold first. COGS is calculated using the costs of the oldest inventory units. Ending inventory is valued using the costs of the most recently purchased goods.

#### LIFO (Last-In, First-Out)
Assumes the newest inventory items are sold first. COGS is calculated using the costs of the most recent acquisitions. In an inflationary environment, LIFO generally results in a higher COGS deduction. **Note**: If you use LIFO, you cannot use "lower of cost or market" to value inventory.

#### Weighted Average
Uses the average cost of all items available for sale during the period to determine COGS and ending inventory value.

### Uniform Capitalization Rules (Section 263A / UNICAP)
Under the uniform capitalization rules, you must capitalize the direct costs and part of the indirect costs for certain production or resale activities. Indirect costs that may need to be capitalized include:
- Rent
- Interest
- Taxes
- Storage
- Purchasing costs
- Processing, repackaging, and handling costs
- Administrative costs

**Small business exception**: For tax years beginning after December 31, 2017, certain small business taxpayers (those meeting the gross receipts test under Section 448(c) -- average annual gross receipts of $30 million or less for the 3 prior tax years) are exempt from the requirements of Section 263A.

### Consistency Requirement
The IRS requires taxpayers to use an inventory method that clearly reflects income and demands consistent application year over year. A change in the valuation method requires formal IRS consent through the filing of **Form 3115, Application for Change in Accounting Method**.
