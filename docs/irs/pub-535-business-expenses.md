## 1. General Rule for Deducting Business Expenses

To be deductible, a business expense must be both **ordinary** and **necessary**:

- **Ordinary**: Common and accepted in your trade, business, or profession.
- **Necessary**: Helpful and appropriate for your trade or business (does not need to be indispensable).

Expenses must be directly connected with the taxpayer's trade or business activity.
Personal, living, or family expenses are not deductible unless they have a clear
business component (e.g., home office, business use of vehicle).

### Common Deductible Business Expenses

- Advertising and marketing
- Employee salaries, wages, and benefits
- Insurance (business liability, workers' comp, etc.)
- Interest on business loans
- Rent for business property
- Repairs and maintenance
- Supplies and materials
- Business taxes and licenses
- Travel, meals, and transportation
- Depreciation of business assets
- Professional services (legal, accounting)
- Utilities for business premises
- Education expenses (if related to current business)

---

## 2. Meals Deduction (50% Rule)

### General Rule (2024-2025)

Business meals are generally deductible at **50%** of the cost. This applies to meals
with clients, customers, or business associates where business is discussed.

> **Note:** The temporary 100% deduction for restaurant meals (2021-2022 under the
> Consolidated Appropriations Act) has expired. Beginning January 1, 2023, the
> deduction reverts to the standard **50% limitation**.

### Requirements for Deductibility

1. The expense must be an ordinary and necessary business expense.
2. The expense must not be lavish or extravagant under the circumstances.
3. The taxpayer or an employee must be present at the meal.
4. The meal must be provided to a current or potential business customer, client,
   consultant, or similar business contact.
5. In the case of food or beverages provided during or at an entertainment activity,
   they must be purchased separately from the entertainment, or the cost of the food
   and beverages must be stated separately on the bill, invoice, or receipt.

### Meals That Remain 100% Deductible

- Company-wide holiday parties or picnics (for all employees)
- Food or beverages provided to the general public for free (promotional)
- Meals included as taxable compensation to employees
- Food provided through employer-operated eating facilities (de minimis fringe)
- Meals required by federal law during DOT rest periods

### Recordkeeping for Meals

For each meal expense, record:
- Amount
- Date and place
- Business purpose
- Business relationship of attendees
- Names of attendees

## 3. Home Office Deduction

### Eligibility Requirements

To claim the home office deduction, the space must be used:

1. **Exclusively** -- The area must be used only for business (no dual-purpose use).
2. **Regularly** -- The area must be used on a consistent basis for business.
3. As the **principal place of business**, OR a place where you regularly meet clients,
   OR a separate structure used in connection with your business.

> **Important:** The home office deduction is available only to self-employed
> individuals and certain statutory employees. W-2 employees cannot claim this
> deduction under current law (post-TCJA).

### Method 1: Simplified Method

| Parameter                 | Value                          |
|---------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Rate per square foot      | $5.00                          |
| Maximum square footage    | 300 sq ft                      |
| Maximum annual deduction  | **$1,500**                     |
| Depreciation              | Not allowed under this method  |
| Carryover of excess       | Not applicable                 |

**Advantages:**
- No depreciation calculation or recapture concerns
- Simpler recordkeeping (just measure the office area)
- Mortgage interest and property taxes still fully deductible on Schedule A

**Limitations:**
- Cannot deduct depreciation or Section 179 expense for the home office space
- Maximum deduction capped at $1,500/year
- Cannot carry forward unused deduction amounts

### Method 2: Regular Method (Form 8829)

Form 8829, "Expenses for Business Use of Your Home," is used to calculate the
deduction under the regular (actual expense) method.

#### Calculating the Business-Use Percentage

```
Business-Use % = (Square footage of office) / (Total square footage of home)
```

Alternatively, if rooms are approximately equal in size:
```
Business-Use % = (Number of rooms used for business) / (Total rooms in home)
```

#### Direct vs. Indirect Expenses

| Type     | Description                                        | Deduction        |
|----------|----------------------------------------------------|------------------|
| Direct   | Expenses solely for the business area              | 100% deductible  |
|          | (e.g., painting the office, office-only repairs)   |                  |
| Indirect | Expenses for the entire home                       | Business-Use %   |
|          | (e.g., mortgage interest, utilities, insurance,    |                  |
|          | rent, repairs, real estate taxes, depreciation)    |                  |

#### Deduction Limitation

The home office deduction under the regular method **cannot exceed the net income
from the business** (gross business income minus all other business expenses). If
expenses exceed income, the excess can be **carried forward** to the next tax year.

#### Form 8829 Structure

- **Part I** -- Part of your home used for business (calculates business-use %)
- **Part II** -- Figure your allowable deduction (categorizes direct/indirect expenses)
- **Part III** -- Depreciation of your home (calculates depreciation on business portion)
- **Part IV** -- Carryover of unallowed expenses to next year

The resulting deduction flows to **Schedule C, Line 30**.

#### Depreciation of Home (Regular Method)

Under the regular method, the business-use portion of the home is depreciated using:
- **Recovery period:** 39 years (nonresidential real property) or the applicable
  residential rental property period
- **Method:** Straight-line
- **Convention:** Mid-month

> **Depreciation recapture:** If you later sell your home, you may owe depreciation
> recapture tax on the amount of depreciation allowed or allowable, even if you used
> the simplified method in some years.

## 4. Self-Employed Health Insurance Deduction

### Overview

Self-employed individuals may deduct health insurance premiums as an adjustment to
income (above-the-line deduction) on **Schedule 1, Line 17**. This is computed using
**Form 7206** (Self-Employed Health Insurance Deduction).

### What Qualifies

- Medical insurance premiums
- Dental insurance premiums
- Vision insurance premiums
- Qualified long-term care insurance premiums (subject to age-based limits)

Coverage may be for:
- The taxpayer
- The taxpayer's spouse
- The taxpayer's dependents
- Children under age 27 (even if not dependents)

### Eligibility Requirements

1. You must have **net self-employment income** from the trade or business under
   which the insurance plan is established.
2. The insurance plan must be established under your business (or you are eligible
   to establish it).
3. You **cannot** be eligible to participate in a subsidized health plan through
   your own employer or your spouse's employer for any month you claim the deduction.

### Critical Limitation: Net Self-Employment Income

The deduction **cannot exceed** the taxpayer's **net profit** from the business under
which the insurance plan is established (Schedule C net profit, or the taxpayer's share
of S corp or partnership income).

```
Deduction = MIN(premiums paid, net self-employment income from that business)
```

**Additional nuances:**

- The deduction is calculated **after** subtracting the deductible portion of
  self-employment tax (Schedule 1, Line 15) and any qualified retirement plan
  contributions (Schedule 1, Line 16).
- You **cannot** use this deduction to create or increase a net loss from the business.
- You **cannot** subtract the self-employed health insurance deduction when
  calculating net earnings for self-employment tax purposes.

### Where Reported

- Computed on **Form 7206**
- Reported on **Schedule 1 (Form 1040), Line 17**
- This is an above-the-line deduction (reduces AGI, available even if not itemizing)

### Interaction with Premium Tax Credit

If you received advance premium tax credit (APTC) or claim the premium tax credit
(Form 8962), the self-employed health insurance deduction and PTC must be calculated
iteratively, as each affects the other. Use the iterative calculation in the Form 7206
instructions or Publication 974.

## 5. Car and Truck Expenses

### Two Methods Available

Self-employed individuals can deduct car and truck expenses using either:

1. **Standard Mileage Rate Method**
2. **Actual Expense Method**

### Standard Mileage Rate

| Tax Year | Business Rate (per mile) | Depreciation Component |
|----------|--------------------------|------------------------|
| 2023     | $0.655                   | $0.28                  |
| 2024     | **$0.67**                | $0.30                  |
| 2025     | **$0.70**                | $0.33                  |

**Requirements for using the standard mileage rate:**

- Must use this method in the **first year** the vehicle is placed in service for
  business (if you want to use it at all). You can switch to actual expenses in later
  years, but not the reverse.
- Cannot use the standard mileage rate if you claimed depreciation using any method
  other than straight-line, claimed Section 179 on the vehicle, or claimed bonus
  depreciation.
- Cannot use if you operate five or more vehicles simultaneously (fleet operations).

**In addition to mileage**, you can also deduct:

- Parking fees and tolls for business trips
- Interest on a car loan (business portion)
- Personal property tax on the vehicle (business portion)

### Actual Expense Method

Deduct the actual costs of operating the vehicle for business, multiplied by the
business-use percentage:

**Deductible actual expenses include:**
- Gas and oil
- Repairs and maintenance
- Tires
- Insurance
- Registration fees and licenses
- Depreciation (or lease payments)
- Garage rent
- Loan interest (business portion)

```
Deduction = Total actual expenses x (Business miles / Total miles)
```

### Recordkeeping Requirements

You must maintain a contemporaneous log documenting:
- Total miles driven during the year
- Business miles driven
- Date of each business trip
- Destination
- Business purpose

---

## 6. Depreciation

### Overview

Depreciation is a method of recovering the cost of property used in a trade or
business over a specified number of years. The primary system used is **MACRS**
(Modified Accelerated Cost Recovery System).

### MACRS -- General Depreciation System (GDS)

GDS is the default and most commonly used system.

| Recovery Period | Depreciation Method | Property Examples                                       |
|-----------------|---------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| 3-year          | 200% DB / SL        | Tractor units, racehorses (2+ years old), rent-to-own   |
| 5-year          | 200% DB / SL        | Automobiles, computers, office equipment, appliances,    |
|                 |                     | research equipment, cattle, certain renewable energy     |
| 7-year          | 200% DB / SL        | Office furniture and fixtures, agricultural machinery,   |
|                 |                     | railroad track, any property not designated elsewhere    |
| 10-year         | 200% DB / SL        | Water transportation equipment, single-purpose           |
|                 |                     | agricultural/horticultural structures                    |
| 15-year         | 150% DB / SL        | Land improvements (roads, bridges, fences), restaurant   |
|                 |                     | property, retail motor fuel outlets, municipal           |
|                 |                     | wastewater treatment                                     |
| 20-year         | 150% DB / SL        | Farm buildings (non-agricultural/horticultural),         |
|                 |                     | municipal sewers                                         |
| 27.5-year       | Straight-line        | Residential rental property                             |
| 39-year         | Straight-line        | Nonresidential real property                            |

**DB = Declining Balance; SL = Straight-Line**

### MACRS -- Alternative Depreciation System (ADS)

ADS uses straight-line depreciation over longer recovery periods. ADS is **required**
for:
- Listed property used 50% or less for business
- Tax-exempt use property
- Tax-exempt bond-financed property
- Property used predominantly outside the United States
- Imported property from certain countries
- Any property for which the taxpayer elects ADS

### Conventions

| Convention  | Rule                                                           |
|-------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Half-year   | All property placed in service (or disposed of) during the     |
|             | year is treated as placed in service at the midpoint of the    |
|             | year. Default for most personal property.                      |
| Mid-quarter | Applies if more than 40% of all personal property is placed    |
|             | in service during the last quarter of the tax year.            |
| Mid-month   | Used for real property (residential and nonresidential).       |

---

## 7. Section 179 Expensing

### Overview

Section 179 allows a taxpayer to elect to deduct the cost of qualifying business
property as an expense in the year it is placed in service, rather than depreciating
it over multiple years.

### Annual Limits

| Tax Year | Maximum Deduction | Phase-Out Threshold | Phase-Out Complete    |
|----------|-------------------|---------------------|-----------------------|
| 2024     | **$1,220,000**    | $3,050,000          | $4,270,000            |
| 2025     | **$1,250,000**    | $3,130,000          | $4,380,000            |

> **One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) -- enacted 2025:** For property placed in
> service after December 31, 2024, the OBBBA increases the Section 179 limit to
> **$2,500,000** with a phase-out threshold of **$4,000,000**. Both amounts are
> indexed for inflation beginning in 2026. Check the effective date and final
> regulations for applicability.

### Phase-Out Rule

The maximum Section 179 deduction is **reduced dollar-for-dollar** by the amount by
which the total cost of Section 179 property placed in service during the year
**exceeds** the phase-out threshold.

### Qualifying Property

- Tangible personal property (machinery, equipment, furniture)
- Off-the-shelf computer software
- Qualified real property (qualified improvement property, roofs, HVAC, fire
  protection, alarm systems, and security systems for nonresidential real property)
- Single-purpose agricultural or horticultural structures
- Certain storage facilities

### SUV Limitation

| Tax Year | Maximum Section 179 for SUVs (GVW > 6,000 lbs) |
|----------|--------------------------------------------------|
| 2024     | **$30,500**                                      |
| 2025     | **$31,300**                                      |

### Taxable Income Limitation

The Section 179 deduction **cannot exceed** the aggregate amount of taxable income
derived from the active conduct of any trade or business. Excess amounts can be
**carried forward** to succeeding tax years.

### Order of Deductions

The IRS requires deductions be claimed in this order:
1. **Section 179 expensing** (first)
2. **Bonus depreciation / Special depreciation allowance** (second)
3. **Regular MACRS depreciation** (third)

---

## 8. Bonus Depreciation (Special Depreciation Allowance)

### Phase-Down Schedule

| Year Property Placed in Service | Bonus Depreciation % |
|---------------------------------|----------------------|
| 2022                            | 100%                 |
| 2023                            | 80%                  |
| 2024                            | **60%**              |
| 2025                            | **40%**              |
| 2026                            | 20%                  |
| 2027+                           | 0%                   |

> **OBBBA (2025):** The One Big Beautiful Bill Act retroactively restores **100%
> bonus depreciation** for property placed in service after December 31, 2024. Verify
> final enactment details and effective dates.

### Qualifying Property for Bonus Depreciation

- MACRS property with a recovery period of 20 years or less
- Qualified improvement property
- Computer software depreciable over 3 years
- Water utility property
- Qualified film, television, or live theatrical productions
- Specified plants (planted or grafted after September 27, 2017)
