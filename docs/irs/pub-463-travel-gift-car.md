## 1. Travel Expenses (Away From Home)

### Tax Home

Your **tax home** is generally your regular place of business or post of duty, regardless of where you maintain your family residence. If you have more than one regular place of business, your tax home is your main place of business. Factors considered include:

- Total time ordinarily spent in each location
- Level of business activity in each location
- Relative financial return from each location

If you have no regular or main place of business, your tax home may be the place where you regularly live.

### Travel Away From Home

You are considered traveling away from home if your duties require you to be away from the general area of your tax home for a period substantially longer than an ordinary day's work, and you need to get sleep or rest to meet the demands of your work while away.

Deductible travel expenses include:

- Transportation (air, rail, bus, car) between your tax home and business destination
- Taxi, rideshare, or other local transportation between airport/station and hotel, or between hotel and work location
- Lodging and meals when away from home on business
- Baggage and shipping costs
- Dry cleaning and laundry
- Business calls and communications
- Tips related to the above services

### Temporary vs. Indefinite Assignments

| Assignment Type | Duration | Tax Treatment |
|---|---|---|
| **Temporary** | Expected to last 1 year or less | Travel expenses ARE deductible |
| **Indefinite** | Expected to last more than 1 year | Travel expenses are NOT deductible; the new location becomes your tax home |

### The 1-Year Rule

- If you realistically expect an assignment to last **1 year or less**, it is temporary and travel expenses are deductible.
- If you realistically expect it to last **more than 1 year**, it is indefinite from the start and travel expenses are not deductible.
- An assignment that is initially temporary may **become indefinite** if expectations change -- deductions stop from the date expectations change.
- **Exception:** Federal employees participating in a federal crime investigation or prosecution are not subject to the 1-year rule.

### Travel Within the United States

If travel is primarily for business, the entire cost of transportation to and from the destination is deductible. If primarily personal, no transportation cost is deductible. For mixed-purpose days, only business-related lodging and meals for business days are deductible.

### Travel Outside the United States

If the trip is entirely for business, or lasts one week or less, or less than 25% of total time is personal, the full transportation cost is deductible. Otherwise, transportation must be allocated between business and personal days.

## 2. Transportation Expenses

### What Qualifies

Transportation expenses are the costs of getting from one workplace to another in the course of your business when you are not traveling away from home. This includes travel between your office and a client's location, between two different business locations, or from your home office to a business location.

### Commuting -- NOT Deductible

**Commuting expenses between your home and your main place of work are never deductible**, regardless of how far you live from your workplace. This includes costs of driving, parking at your main workplace, tolls, and public transit.

Exceptions:

- You have a **regular office** but travel to a temporary work location in the same trade or business (deductible)
- You have a **home office** qualifying as your principal place of business -- travel from home to another work location in the same trade or business is deductible
- You have **no regular office** and commute to a temporary work location outside your metropolitan area (deductible)

### Standard Mileage Rate Method

| Tax Year | Standard Mileage Rate |
|---|---|
| **2025** | **$0.70 per mile** (70 cents) |
| 2024 | $0.67 per mile (67 cents) |

To use the standard mileage rate:

- You must **own or lease** the car
- You must **not** operate five or more cars simultaneously (fleet operations)
- You must **not** have claimed depreciation using any method other than straight-line in a prior year
- You must **not** have claimed a Section 179 deduction on the car
- You must **not** have claimed the special depreciation allowance (bonus depreciation) on the car
- You must choose the standard mileage rate in the **first year** the car is available for business; in later years, you can switch between standard mileage rate and actual expenses

The standard mileage rate includes: gas, oil, repairs, insurance, registration fees, depreciation/lease payments. It does NOT include: parking fees and tolls (deduct these separately), interest on a car loan (deduct separately if self-employed).

### Actual Expense Method

Under the actual expense method, deduct the business-use percentage of all car operating costs:

- **Depreciation** (or lease payments)
- Gas and oil
- Tires
- Repairs and maintenance
- Insurance
- Registration fees and licenses
- Garage rent
- Parking fees and tolls (business-related)

You must track actual total miles and business miles to compute the business-use percentage.

### Parking Fees and Tolls

Business-related parking fees and tolls are **separately deductible** whether you use the standard mileage rate or actual expenses. Parking at your regular place of work is commuting and is **not deductible**.

---

## 3. Car Expenses -- Depreciation and Special Rules

### MACRS Depreciation

Cars are classified as **5-year MACRS property**. Under the General Depreciation System (GDS), the applicable recovery period is 5 years using the 200% declining balance method, switching to straight-line. The applicable convention is the half-year convention (or mid-quarter convention if more than 40% of all depreciable property is placed in service in the last quarter).

### Luxury Auto Depreciation Caps (Section 280F) -- 2025

**Passenger vehicles placed in service in 2025 (GVWR 6,000 lbs or less):**

| Year | With Bonus Depreciation | Without Bonus Depreciation |
|---|---|---|
| Year 1 | $20,200 | $12,200 |
| Year 2 | $19,600 | $19,600 |
| Year 3 | $11,800 | $11,800 |
| Year 4+ | $7,060 | $7,060 |

### Section 179 Deduction -- 2025

- **General limit:** $1,250,000 (may be higher under H.R.1 provisions effective after 12/31/2024)
- **Phase-out threshold:** $3,130,000
- **SUV limitation (GVWR > 6,000 lbs):** $31,300 cap for Section 179
- Business use must exceed **50%** to claim Section 179 or bonus depreciation

### Bonus Depreciation -- 2025

- Property acquired on or after January 20, 2025: **100% bonus depreciation** may be available under H.R.1 provisions
- Property acquired before that date and placed in service in 2025: **40% bonus depreciation** (phase-down schedule from TCJA)
- Subject to the Section 280F luxury auto dollar caps for passenger vehicles

### Heavy Vehicles (GVWR > 6,000 lbs)

Vehicles with GVWR exceeding 6,000 lbs (heavy SUVs, trucks, vans) are **not subject to the luxury auto dollar caps** under Section 280F. They are eligible for full Section 179 (up to the $31,300 SUV cap) and bonus depreciation without dollar caps (though still limited by the general Section 179 ceiling and business-use percentage).

### Leased Vehicles -- Inclusion Amount

If you lease a car for **30 days or more**, you may have to reduce your lease deduction by an **inclusion amount** to account for the equivalent of the luxury auto depreciation limits. Tables for inclusion amounts are published in Appendix A of Publication 463 (updated annually).

### Business Use Below 50%

If business use falls to **50% or below** in any year during the recovery period:

- You cannot use Section 179 or bonus depreciation
- You must use the **straight-line method** over 5 years
- You may have to **recapture** (include in income) excess depreciation previously claimed

---

## 4. Meals

### 50% Limitation

You can generally deduct only **50%** of the cost of business meals. This applies whether you use:

- Actual cost of meals, or
- The standard meal allowance (per diem)

### When Meals Are Deductible

Meals are deductible when:

- You are traveling **away from home** on business
- The meal is **business-related** and not lavish or extravagant
- You or an employee is present at the meal
- The meal is provided to a current or potential business customer, client, consultant, or similar business contact

### Per Diem Rates (Standard Meal Allowance)

Instead of tracking actual meal costs, you may use **per diem rates** published by the IRS:

**High-Low Substantiation Method (effective Oct. 1, 2025 -- Sep. 30, 2026):**

| Locality | Total Per Diem | Meals & Incidentals (M&IE) |
|---|---|---|
| High-cost | $319/day | $86/day |
| Other (low-cost) | $225/day | $74/day |

**Special rates:**

- **Transportation industry:** $80/day (CONUS), $86/day (OCONUS)
- **Incidental expenses only:** $5/day
- **Federal per diem rates** by specific locality are published at [GSA.gov/perdiem](https://www.gsa.gov/travel/plan-book/per-diem-rates)

The 50% limitation still applies to the meals portion of per diem allowances.

### Adequate Records for Meals

You must document:

- **Amount** of the expense
- **Date and place** of the meal
- **Business purpose** of the meal
- **Business relationship** of the persons involved

---

## 5. Entertainment Expenses

### Generally NOT Deductible (Post-TCJA)

Under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (TCJA), effective for amounts paid or incurred after December 31, 2017:

- **Entertainment, amusement, or recreation expenses are generally NOT deductible** -- even if directly related to or associated with the conduct of your trade or business
- This includes expenses for sporting events, theater, golf, concerts, nightclubs, country clubs, social clubs, and similar activities

### Exceptions

Limited exceptions where entertainment may still be deductible:

- Entertainment treated as **compensation** to an employee (reported on W-2)
- Entertainment made available to the **general public** (e.g., promotional events)
- Entertainment provided at company-wide events primarily for **employees** (e.g., holiday parties, company picnics)
- Entertainment sold to customers (included in income)

### Meals Separated from Entertainment

If food and beverages are purchased at an entertainment event and are **separately stated** on the bill, the meal portion may be deductible at 50% even though the entertainment itself is not deductible. The food and beverages must not be lavish or extravagant.

---

## 6. Business Gifts

### $25 Per Person Annual Limit

You can deduct no more than **$25** per person per tax year for business gifts given directly or indirectly. This is a long-standing limit that has not been adjusted for inflation.

### Rules and Exceptions

- If you give a gift to a member of a customer's family, it counts toward the $25 limit for that customer
- A gift to a company intended for the **personal use of a particular individual** counts toward that individual's $25 limit
- **Incidental costs** (engraving, wrapping, mailing, insurance) are NOT included in the $25 limit if they do not add substantial value to the gift
- Items costing **$4 or less** that have your name clearly and permanently imprinted on them and are one of a number widely distributed (pens, calendars, etc.) are **excluded** from the gift rules entirely
- **Signs, display racks, or other promotional material** used on the recipient's business premises are not treated as gifts

### Gift vs. Entertainment

If you provide a gift that could also be considered entertainment, you must generally treat it as entertainment (and it is therefore nondeductible under post-TCJA rules). However, items of nominal value (e.g., branded merchandise) may still qualify as gifts.

---

## 7. Recordkeeping Requirements

### General Rule -- Contemporaneous Records

You must keep records that are **adequate** and **contemporaneous** (recorded at or near the time of the expense). A log, diary, trip sheet, or similar record made at the time of the expense has more evidentiary value than a statement prepared later.

### What to Record

For each deductible expense, you must substantiate:

| Element | Travel | Transportation | Meals | Gifts |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Amount** | Cost of each separate expense (lodging, meals, transport) | Cost of each expense, or mileage for car | Cost of meal (including tip) | Cost of gift |
| **Date** | Dates of departure and return; dates for each business day | Date of travel | Date of meal | Date of gift |
| **Place** | Destination or area of travel | Business destination | Name and location of restaurant | N/A |
| **Business Purpose** | Business reason for travel | Business reason for transport | Business purpose; nature of discussion | Business purpose for gift |
| **Business Relationship** | N/A | N/A | Name and occupation/title of each person present | Name and occupation/title of recipient |

### Documentary Evidence

You need **receipts or other documentary evidence** for:

- Any lodging expense while traveling away from home
- Any other expense of **$75 or more** (except transportation charges where a receipt is not readily available)

Documentary evidence includes receipts, canceled checks, credit card statements, or bills that show the amount, date, place, and character of the expense.

### How Long to Keep Records

Keep records and receipts for as long as the period of limitations for the tax return -- generally **3 years from the date filed** or **2 years from the date tax paid**, whichever is later.

### Accountable vs. Nonaccountable Reimbursement Plans

**Accountable plan** (employer reimbursement) -- requires:
1. Business connection for expenses
2. Adequate accounting to employer within a reasonable time
3. Return of excess reimbursement within a reasonable time

Under an accountable plan, reimbursements are **not reported as income** on Form W-2 and are not subject to income or employment taxes.

**Nonaccountable plan** -- reimbursements are treated as **wages** on Form W-2, and the employee cannot deduct unreimbursed expenses (for W-2 employees, unreimbursed employee business expenses are not deductible for 2018-2025 under TCJA).
