## Overview

The **Report of Foreign Bank and Financial Accounts (FBAR)**, officially **FinCEN Form 114**, is an annual report filed with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), a bureau of the U.S. Department of the Treasury. The FBAR is **not** an IRS tax form -- it is a separate Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) reporting requirement. However, the IRS has been delegated authority to enforce FBAR compliance.

The FBAR exists to combat tax evasion, money laundering, and other financial crimes by ensuring the U.S. government has visibility into the foreign financial holdings of U.S. persons.

**Key Point:** Filing an FBAR is separate from and in addition to any reporting obligations on your tax return (such as Form 8938). Meeting one requirement does NOT satisfy the other.

---

## Who Must File

A **U.S. person** must file an FBAR if they had a financial interest in, or signature or other authority over, at least one financial account located outside the United States, and the **aggregate value** of all foreign financial accounts exceeded **$10,000 at any time during the calendar year**.

### Definition of "U.S. Person"

- U.S. citizens (including those living abroad)
- U.S. residents (green card holders and those meeting the substantial presence test)
- Domestic entities: corporations, partnerships, LLCs, trusts, and estates formed or organized in the United States or under the laws of the United States

### "Financial Interest" Includes

- Owner of record or holder of legal title
- Agent, nominee, attorney, or representative capacity with authority comparable to an owner
- More than 50% ownership interest (directly or indirectly) in a corporation, partnership, or trust that owns the foreign account
- Trust grantor or beneficiary receiving trust income (the trustee may also have an independent filing obligation)

---

## The $10,000 Aggregate Threshold

The **$10,000 threshold** is the most critical concept in FBAR filing and is frequently misunderstood.

### How It Works

- The threshold is based on the **aggregate maximum value** of ALL foreign financial accounts at **any point** during the calendar year
- You do NOT need to have $10,000 in any single account -- if the combined total of all accounts exceeded $10,000 at any time, you must file
- You report ALL accounts, not just those that individually exceeded $10,000
- The threshold is measured in U.S. dollars; convert foreign currency using the Treasury Reporting Rate of Exchange for the last day of the calendar year

### Example

If you have three foreign accounts with maximum balances during the year of $4,000, $3,500, and $3,000, the aggregate is $10,500. Even though no single account exceeded $10,000, you must file an FBAR and report **all three** accounts.

### Accounts with Zero Balance

An account with a zero balance at year-end but that held funds at some point during the year must still be counted toward the aggregate threshold.

---

## What Accounts Must Be Reported

### Reportable Foreign Financial Accounts

- **Bank accounts** -- checking, savings, time deposits (CDs)
- **Securities accounts** -- brokerage accounts held at foreign financial institutions
- **Mutual fund accounts** -- shares in pooled investment funds maintained by foreign institutions
- **Retirement accounts** -- foreign pension accounts, foreign retirement savings plans (e.g., Canadian RRSPs, UK SIPPs, Australian superannuation)
- **Insurance policies** with a cash value (e.g., foreign life insurance with investment component)
- **Trust interests** -- accounts held by a foreign trust in which you have a financial interest
- **Commodity futures or options accounts**
- **Accounts held at a foreign branch of a U.S. financial institution**

### What Is a "Foreign" Account?

An account is foreign if it is maintained with a financial institution located **outside** the United States, including U.S. territories. An account at a foreign branch of a U.S. bank IS a foreign account and must be reported.

---

## Signature Authority Accounts

Even if you have **no financial interest** in a foreign account, you must report it on the FBAR if you have **signature authority or other authority** over the account.

### What Constitutes Signature Authority

You have signature authority if you can control the disposition of money, funds, or other assets in the account by delivery of a document containing your signature (or equivalent) to the financial institution.

### Common Scenarios

- Corporate officers or employees who can sign on company foreign accounts
- Non-profit officers with authority over organizational foreign accounts
- Partners or members authorized to transact on entity accounts

### Exemptions from Signature Authority Reporting

Certain individuals may be exempt from reporting signature authority accounts (though they still report accounts in which they have a financial interest):

- Officers and employees of certain entities that are SEC-registered (if the entity files a consolidated FBAR)
- Officers and employees of entities with equity securities listed on a U.S. national securities exchange
- Officers and employees of U.S. subsidiaries of such entities
- Officers and employees of banks examined by federal banking regulators

## Filing Deadline and Extensions

| Item | Date |
|------|------|
| **Original due date** | **April 15** following the calendar year being reported |
| **Automatic extension** | **October 15** (no form or request needed) |
| **Extension request** | Not applicable -- extension is automatic |

### Key Points

- The FBAR is filed for a **calendar year** (January 1 - December 31), regardless of the taxpayer's tax year
- If April 15 falls on a weekend or holiday, the deadline moves to the next business day
- There is **no further extension** beyond October 15
- The automatic extension was implemented starting with the 2016 calendar year FBAR
- No penalty will be assessed for failing to file by April 15 as long as the FBAR is filed by October 15

---

## How to File (BSA E-Filing Only)

The FBAR must be filed **electronically** through the BSA E-Filing System. There is no paper filing option.

### Filing Steps

1. Go to the BSA E-Filing System at **https://bsaefiling.fincen.gov**
2. You can file without creating an account (individual filing) or create an account for batch filing
3. Complete FinCEN Form 114 online or upload a completed form
4. Submit electronically -- you will receive a confirmation of receipt

### Who Can File

- The individual filer
- A third party (e.g., CPA, attorney, or enrolled agent) authorized by the filer using **FinCEN Form 114a** (Record of Authorization to Electronically File FBARs)
- Form 114a is **not** submitted to FinCEN -- it is retained by the filer and preparer

### Amended FBARs

If you discover an error on a previously filed FBAR, file an amended FBAR through the BSA E-Filing System. Check the "Amend" box on the form.

---

## Joint Account Rules

If two or more U.S. persons **jointly own** a foreign financial account:

- **Each person** has a financial interest in the account
- **Each person** must file a separate FBAR reporting the **entire value** of the account (not just their share)
- The full balance of the joint account is attributed to each co-owner for threshold and reporting purposes

### Example

A married couple jointly owns a foreign bank account with a maximum value of $15,000. Both spouses must file an FBAR (unless the spouse exception applies), and each reports the full $15,000 value.

---

## Spouse Filing Exception

A **limited exception** exists to avoid duplicative filing by spouses.

### When the Exception Applies

The spouse of an FBAR filer is **not required** to file a separate FBAR if **all** of the following conditions are met:

1. **All** the financial accounts that the non-filing spouse is required to report are **jointly owned** with the filing spouse
2. The filing spouse reports the jointly owned accounts on a **timely filed** FBAR
3. The FBAR is **electronically signed** by the filing spouse
4. Both spouses complete and sign **FinCEN Form 114a** (Record of Authorization to Electronically File FBARs), which is retained in their records (not submitted to FinCEN)

### When the Exception Does NOT Apply

- If the non-filing spouse has **any** foreign accounts that are not jointly owned with the filing spouse (e.g., an individual account, or an account jointly owned with a non-spouse), the spouse exception does not apply and the non-filing spouse must file a separate FBAR reporting ALL of their reportable accounts

---

## Exceptions and Exemptions

### Accounts That Do NOT Need to Be Reported on FBAR

- Accounts at **U.S. military banking facilities** operated by a U.S. financial institution
- **Correspondent or nostro accounts** maintained by banks for interbank transactions
- Accounts owned by **governmental entities** (federal, state, local)
- Accounts owned by certain **international financial institutions** of which the U.S. is a member

### Individuals Exempt from FBAR Filing

- Accounts held in **IRA accounts** (described in IRC Sections 408 and 408A) and **tax-qualified retirement plans** (described in IRC Sections 401(a), 403(a), or 403(b)) do **not** need to be reported on the FBAR
- Participants in certain **deferred compensation plans** under IRC Section 457

### Special Rules for Trust Beneficiaries

A beneficiary of a trust does not have a financial interest in a foreign account held by the trust if:
- The trust is a revocable trust and the beneficiary is NOT the grantor
- A U.S. court exercises primary supervision over the trust administration

---

## Penalties

FBAR penalties are severe and can be assessed **per violation**. As of January 17, 2025, inflation-adjusted penalty amounts apply.

### Non-Willful Violations

| Element | Amount |
|---------|--------|
| **Maximum penalty per violation** | **$16,536** (2025 inflation-adjusted) |
| **Per violation means** | Per unreported account per year (but see Bittner below) |
| **Reasonable cause defense** | Available -- no penalty if violation was due to reasonable cause and the filer properly reported the account on a timely filed amended FBAR |

**Bittner v. United States (2023):** The Supreme Court held that for non-willful violations, the penalty is assessed per FBAR report (i.e., per year), not per account. This significantly limits non-willful penalties for filers with multiple unreported accounts.

### Willful Violations

| Element | Amount |
|---------|--------|
| **Maximum civil penalty** | Greater of **$165,353** or **50% of the account balance** at the time of the violation (2025 inflation-adjusted) |
| **Criminal penalties** | Up to **$500,000** fine and/or **10 years imprisonment** |
| **Per violation means** | Per account per year |

### What Makes a Violation "Willful"?

- Actual knowledge of the reporting requirement and intentional failure to file
- **Willful blindness** -- deliberate avoidance of learning about the FBAR requirement
- Reckless disregard of a known reporting obligation
- The IRS bears the burden of proving willfulness

### Statute of Limitations

- The government has **6 years** from the FBAR due date to assess FBAR penalties
- There is no statute of limitations for criminal violations involving willful violations

---

## Record Keeping Requirements

- FBAR filers must retain records of each reportable account for **5 years** from the due date of the FBAR
- Records should include: the name on the account, account number, name and address of the foreign bank, type of account, and maximum account value during the year

## FBAR vs Form 8938 Comparison

Both the FBAR and Form 8938 require reporting of foreign financial assets, but they are separate requirements with different rules. **You may need to file both.**

| Feature | FBAR (FinCEN Form 114) | Form 8938 (FATCA) |
|---------|------------------------|-------------------|
| **Administered by** | FinCEN (Treasury) | IRS |
| **Legal authority** | Bank Secrecy Act (31 USC 5314) | IRC Section 6038D (FATCA) |
| **Filed with** | FinCEN via BSA E-Filing | IRS (attached to tax return) |
| **Who must file** | U.S. persons (citizens, residents, domestic entities) | Specified individuals and specified domestic entities |
| **Filing threshold** | $10,000 aggregate at any time during the year | Varies by filing status and residency ($50K-$600K) |
| **Types of assets** | Foreign financial **accounts** only | Foreign accounts AND other foreign financial assets (stocks, securities, financial instruments, interests in foreign entities) |
| **Signature authority** | Must report accounts over which you have signature authority even without financial interest | Only financial interest triggers reporting |
| **Filing deadline** | April 15 (auto extension to October 15) | With tax return (including extensions) |
| **Domestic accounts at foreign branches** | Foreign branch of U.S. bank = reportable | Foreign branch of U.S. financial institution = NOT reportable |
| **Non-willful penalty** | Up to $16,536 per violation | $10,000 per failure + $10,000/30 days (max $60,000) |
| **Willful penalty** | Greater of $165,353 or 50% of balance | 40% accuracy-related penalty on underpaid tax |
| **Maximum value or year-end value** | Maximum value during year | Both maximum value and year-end value |
| **Need to file tax return?** | No (FBAR filed independently) | Yes (only filed with a tax return) |
| **Real estate** | Not reportable | Not reportable (unless held through foreign entity) |

### Key Takeaway

If you have foreign financial accounts exceeding $10,000 in aggregate and also meet the Form 8938 threshold, you must file **both** reports. Filing one does not satisfy the other.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Using U.S. dollar amounts only** -- Remember to convert all foreign currency balances using the Treasury year-end exchange rate
2. **Ignoring joint accounts** -- Each co-owner must report the full value of the account
3. **Forgetting signature-authority accounts** -- Even if you have no money in the account, if you can sign on it, you may need to report it
4. **Omitting retirement accounts** -- Foreign pensions, superannuation, and similar accounts are reportable (U.S. IRA and 401(k) accounts holding foreign investments are NOT reportable)
5. **Assuming the threshold is per-account** -- The $10,000 threshold is based on aggregate value across ALL foreign accounts
6. **Not filing because you owe no tax** -- The FBAR is a reporting obligation independent of any tax liability
7. **Trying to paper file** -- The FBAR can ONLY be filed electronically through the BSA E-Filing System
8. **Missing accounts that briefly exceeded the threshold** -- If accounts exceeded $10,000 in aggregate for even one day during the year, you must file
