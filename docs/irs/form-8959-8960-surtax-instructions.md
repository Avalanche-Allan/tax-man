## Part A: Form 8959 -- Additional Medicare Tax

### Purpose

Form 8959 is used to figure:

1. The amount of **Additional Medicare Tax** you owe on Medicare wages, Railroad Retirement Tax Act (RRTA) compensation, and self-employment income that exceeds your filing-status threshold.
2. The amount of **Additional Medicare Tax withheld** by your employer(s).
3. Any **credit for excess withholding** or any **additional tax owed** when filing Form 1040.

The Additional Medicare Tax was enacted as part of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and applies to tax years beginning after December 31, 2012.

---

### Who Must File Form 8959

You must file Form 8959 if **any** of the following apply:

1. **Medicare wages and tips** from any single Form W-2 (box 5) are **greater than $200,000** (this $200,000 withholding threshold applies regardless of filing status).
2. **RRTA compensation** from any single Form W-2 (box 14) is **greater than $200,000**.
3. Your **total** Medicare wages, tips, and self-employment income (combined with your spouse's if MFJ) **exceeds the threshold** for your filing status (see table below).

Even if no Additional Medicare Tax is owed, you must file Form 8959 if your employer withheld Additional Medicare Tax from your wages (i.e., if any single W-2 box 5 exceeded $200,000), because you need Form 8959 to claim the credit for that withholding.

---

### Additional Medicare Tax Rate

| Tax | Rate |
|-----|------|
| Additional Medicare Tax | **0.9%** (0.009) |

This is in addition to the regular 1.45% employee Medicare tax. The combined employee-side rate on wages above the threshold is therefore **2.35%** (1.45% + 0.9%).

There is **no employer match** for the Additional Medicare Tax. The employer continues to pay only 1.45%.

---

### Threshold Amounts by Filing Status

| Filing Status | Threshold Amount |
|---|---|
| Married Filing Jointly (MFJ) | **$250,000** |
| Qualifying Surviving Spouse (QSS) | **$250,000** |
| Single | **$200,000** |
| Head of Household (HoH) | **$200,000** |
| Married Filing Separately (MFS) | **$125,000** |

These thresholds are **not indexed for inflation** -- they remain the same each year.

For MFJ filers, the threshold applies to the **combined** Medicare wages, RRTA compensation, and self-employment income of both spouses.

---

### How Wages and Self-Employment Income Combine for the Threshold Test

The Additional Medicare Tax applies to the **combined total** of Medicare wages and self-employment income. However, because Form 8959 calculates the tax in separate parts (Part I for wages, Part II for SE income, Part III for RRTA), it uses a **waterfall/reduction approach** to avoid double-counting:

1. **First**, apply the full filing-status threshold against Medicare wages (Part I).
2. **Then**, reduce the threshold by the amount of Medicare wages received (but not below zero) before applying it to self-employment income (Part II).
3. **RRTA compensation** is calculated separately (Part III) because RRTA compensation and Medicare wages/SE income are not combined for threshold purposes.

**Step-by-step logic:**

- Part I, Line 5: Enter the threshold for your filing status.
- Part I, Line 6: Subtract Line 5 from Line 4 (total Medicare wages). If zero or less, enter 0.
- Part II, Line 9: Enter the threshold for your filing status.
- Part II, Line 10: Enter your Medicare wages from Part I, Line 4.
- Part II, Line 11: Subtract Line 10 from Line 9. If zero or less, enter 0. This is the **reduced threshold** for SE income.
- Part II, Line 12: Subtract Line 11 from Line 8 (SE income). If zero or less, enter 0.

This ensures every dollar of combined wages + SE income above the threshold is taxed at 0.9%, and no dollar is taxed twice.

---

### Employer Withholding Rules

- Employers **must** begin withholding the 0.9% Additional Medicare Tax in the pay period in which an employee's Medicare wages or RRTA compensation **exceeds $200,000** for the calendar year.
- This **$200,000 withholding trigger** applies to all employees regardless of filing status. The employer does not consider the employee's filing status or other income.
- Withholding continues for each subsequent pay period until the end of the calendar year.
- If you have multiple employers, each employer withholds based only on the wages it pays. As a result:
  - You may have **under-withheld** if combined wages from multiple jobs exceed the threshold but no single employer's wages exceed $200,000.
  - You may have **over-withheld** if, for example, you are MFJ with a $250,000 threshold but your employer withheld Additional Medicare Tax on wages over $200,000.
- Any **excess withholding** is claimed as a credit on Form 1040. Any **shortfall** is owed with the return.
- You cannot request that your employer stop withholding Additional Medicare Tax once it begins.

### Part I: Additional Medicare Tax on Medicare Wages (Lines 1-7)

| Line | Description | Source / Instruction |
|------|-------------|----------------------|
| **1** | Medicare wages and tips | Form(s) W-2, box 5. If multiple W-2s, enter the total of all box 5 amounts. |
| **2** | Unreported tips subject to Medicare tax | Form 4137, line 6. |
| **3** | Wages subject to Medicare tax (uncollected SS/Medicare on tips) | Form 8919, line 6. |
| **4** | Add lines 1, 2, and 3 | This is your **total Medicare wages**. |
| **5** | Enter applicable threshold amount for your filing status | $250,000 (MFJ/QSS), $200,000 (Single/HoH), $125,000 (MFS). |
| **6** | Subtract line 5 from line 4 | If zero or less, enter **-0-**. This is the Medicare wages subject to Additional Medicare Tax. |
| **7** | **Additional Medicare Tax on Medicare wages:** Multiply line 6 by **0.009** (0.9%) | This is your Additional Medicare Tax on wages. Enter here and carry to Part IV. |

---

### Part II: Additional Medicare Tax on Self-Employment Income (Lines 8-13)

| Line | Description | Source / Instruction |
|------|-------------|----------------------|
| **8** | Self-employment income | Schedule SE, Section A, line 4a, or Section B, line 6. This is the amount **before** subtracting the deduction for one-half of SE tax, but it is the amount from Schedule SE (which is 92.35% of net SE earnings for most taxpayers). |
| **9** | Enter applicable threshold amount for your filing status | Same thresholds as Part I: $250,000 / $200,000 / $125,000. |
| **10** | Enter your Medicare wages and tips from Part I, line 4 | This reduces the threshold to prevent double-counting. |
| **11** | Subtract line 10 from line 9 | If zero or less, enter **-0-**. This is the **reduced threshold** for self-employment income. |
| **12** | Subtract line 11 from line 8 | If zero or less, enter **-0-**. This is the self-employment income subject to Additional Medicare Tax. |
| **13** | **Additional Medicare Tax on SE income:** Multiply line 12 by **0.009** (0.9%) | This is your Additional Medicare Tax on self-employment income. Enter here and carry to Part IV. |

**Key concept:** The threshold is first applied to wages. Whatever portion of the threshold is "used up" by wages is no longer available for self-employment income. This is how the IRS enforces a single combined threshold.

---

### Part III: Additional Medicare Tax on Railroad Retirement (RRTA) Compensation (Lines 14-17)

| Line | Description | Source / Instruction |
|------|-------------|----------------------|
| **14** | Railroad retirement (RRTA) compensation and tips | Form(s) W-2, box 14 (Tier I RRTA compensation). If multiple W-2s, enter the total. |
| **15** | Enter applicable threshold amount for your filing status | $250,000 / $200,000 / $125,000. |
| **16** | Subtract line 15 from line 14 | If zero or less, enter **-0-**. |
| **17** | **Additional Medicare Tax on RRTA compensation:** Multiply line 16 by **0.009** (0.9%) | This is your Additional Medicare Tax on RRTA compensation. Enter here and carry to Part IV. |

**Important:** RRTA compensation is **not** combined with Medicare wages or SE income for threshold purposes. It has its own separate threshold test. You cannot receive both Medicare wages and RRTA compensation for the same services; they are mutually exclusive categories.

---

### Part IV: Total Additional Medicare Tax (Line 18)

| Line | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **18** | **Add lines 7, 13, and 17.** This is your **total Additional Medicare Tax**. |

This amount is entered on Schedule 2 (Form 1040), line 23 (Additional Medicare Tax), which then flows to Form 1040, line 23 as part of total tax.

---

### Part V: Withholding Reconciliation (Lines 19-24)

This section determines how much Additional Medicare Tax your employer(s) actually withheld, so you can claim it as a credit.

| Line | Description | Source / Instruction |
|------|-------------|----------------------|
| **19** | Medicare tax withheld | Form(s) W-2, box 6. If multiple W-2s, enter the total. This includes **both** the regular 1.45% Medicare tax **and** any Additional Medicare Tax (0.9%) withheld. |
| **20** | Enter your Medicare wages and tips from Part I, line 1 | Only line 1 (not lines 2-3). This is the W-2 box 5 amount. |
| **21** | Multiply line 20 by **0.0145** (1.45%) | This calculates what the **regular** Medicare tax withholding should be on your W-2 wages. |
| **22** | Subtract line 21 from line 19 | If zero or less, enter **-0-**. This isolates the **Additional Medicare Tax withholding** on wages (the excess over the regular 1.45%). |
| **23** | Additional Medicare Tax withholding on RRTA compensation | Enter Additional Medicare Tax withheld on RRTA compensation from Form W-2, box 14. |
| **24** | **Total Additional Medicare Tax withholding.** Add lines 22 and 23. | Include this amount on Form 1040, line 25c (or line 25d for 1040-NR), combined with other withholding credits. |

---

### Where Form 8959 Flows to Form 1040

| Form 8959 Line | Flows To |
|----------------|----------|
| Line 18 (Total Additional Medicare Tax) | Schedule 2 (Form 1040), line 23. Then to Form 1040, line 23 (total tax). |
| Line 24 (Total withholding) | Form 1040, line 25c (or 25d for 1040-NR), as a credit against tax. |

If Line 24 exceeds Line 18, the excess Additional Medicare Tax withheld reduces your total tax liability or increases your refund. If Line 18 exceeds the withholding reflected on Line 24, you owe the difference.

---

### Form 8959 Examples

**Example 1: Single filer with wages only**

- Filing status: Single (threshold $200,000)
- W-2 box 5 (Medicare wages): $280,000
- Part I, Line 6: $280,000 - $200,000 = $80,000
- Part I, Line 7: $80,000 x 0.009 = **$720 Additional Medicare Tax**

**Example 2: MFJ with wages + self-employment income (combined threshold)**

- Filing status: MFJ (threshold $250,000)
- Spouse A W-2 Medicare wages: $150,000
- Spouse B self-employment income (from Schedule SE): $175,000
- **Part I (Wages):**
  - Line 4: $150,000
  - Line 5: $250,000
  - Line 6: $150,000 - $250,000 = negative, so enter **$0**
  - Line 7: $0 x 0.009 = **$0**
- **Part II (Self-Employment):**
  - Line 8: $175,000
  - Line 9: $250,000 (threshold)
  - Line 10: $150,000 (Medicare wages from Line 4)
  - Line 11: $250,000 - $150,000 = **$100,000** (reduced threshold)
  - Line 12: $175,000 - $100,000 = **$75,000**
  - Line 13: $75,000 x 0.009 = **$675 Additional Medicare Tax**
- **Part IV, Line 18:** $0 + $675 + $0 = **$675 total**

**Example 3: MFJ with wages from both spouses (Kathleen & Liam)**

- Filing status: MFJ (threshold $250,000)
- Kathleen wages (Medicare, W-2 box 5): $130,000
- Liam self-employment income: $140,000
- Combined: $270,000 (exceeds $250,000 by $20,000)
- Part I: $130,000 wages < $250,000 threshold, so Line 7 = $0
- Part II: Threshold reduced by $130,000 wages: $250,000 - $130,000 = $120,000
  - SE income exceeding reduced threshold: $140,000 - $120,000 = $20,000
  - Line 13: $20,000 x 0.009 = **$180 Additional Medicare Tax**

## Part B: Form 8960 -- Net Investment Income Tax (NIIT)

### Purpose

Form 8960 is used to figure the **Net Investment Income Tax (NIIT)**, a 3.8% surtax imposed by Internal Revenue Code section 1411 on certain net investment income of individuals, estates, and trusts.

The NIIT was also enacted as part of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and applies to tax years beginning after December 31, 2012.

---

### Who Must File Form 8960

**Individuals** must file Form 8960 if they have:
- Net investment income, **AND**
- Modified adjusted gross income (MAGI) over the threshold amount for their filing status.

Even if the NIIT ends up being zero (because the lesser-of calculation yields zero), you should file Form 8960 if you are close to or exceed the thresholds.

**Estates and trusts** must file Form 8960 if they have undistributed net investment income and adjusted gross income over the threshold for the highest income tax bracket for estates and trusts.

The following trusts are **exempt** from NIIT:
- Trusts that are exempt from income taxes under section 501
- Charitable remainder trusts exempt under section 664
- Grantor trusts (the grantor, not the trust, reports the income)
- Trusts where all unexpired interests are devoted to charitable purposes
- Electing Alaska Native Settlement Trusts
- Certain cemetery perpetual care funds

---

### NIIT Tax Rate

| Tax | Rate |
|-----|------|
| Net Investment Income Tax (NIIT) | **3.8%** (0.038) |

---

### NIIT Threshold Amounts by Filing Status

| Filing Status | Threshold Amount |
|---|---|
| Married Filing Jointly (MFJ) | **$250,000** |
| Qualifying Surviving Spouse (QSS) | **$250,000** |
| Single | **$200,000** |
| Head of Household (HoH) | **$200,000** |
| Married Filing Separately (MFS) | **$125,000** |
| Estates and Trusts | The dollar amount at which the **highest income tax bracket** for estates/trusts begins for the tax year (for 2025: **$15,650**) |

These thresholds for individuals are **not indexed for inflation**. The estate/trust threshold is indexed annually.

---

### What IS Net Investment Income

Net investment income generally includes (but is not limited to):

1. **Taxable interest** (e.g., bank interest, bond interest, etc.)
2. **Dividends** (both ordinary dividends and qualified dividends)
3. **Capital gains** (net gains from the sale of stocks, bonds, mutual funds, and real estate to the extent taken into account in computing taxable income; includes short-term and long-term capital gains)
4. **Rental income and royalty income** (net of expenses)
5. **Non-qualified annuity income** (the taxable portion)
6. **Income from passive activities** -- income from a trade or business that is a passive activity with respect to the taxpayer under section 469
7. **Income from trading** -- income from a trade or business of trading in financial instruments or commodities
8. **Net gains from disposition of property** (other than property held in an active trade or business), including gains from the sale of partnership interests and S corporation stock attributable to the entity's investment assets
9. **Other income from investment of working capital**
10. **Income from CFCs and PFICs** to the extent provided by IRS regulations (see special rules below)

---

### What IS NOT Net Investment Income

The following types of income are **excluded** from net investment income:

1. **Wages and salaries**
2. **Self-employment income** that is not passive
3. **Social Security benefits**
4. **Unemployment compensation**
5. **Alimony**
6. **Tax-exempt interest** (e.g., municipal bond interest)
7. **Distributions from tax-deferred retirement plans** -- including 401(k), 403(b), 457(b), traditional IRA, and Roth IRA distributions (to the extent not otherwise subject to income tax)
8. **Veterans' benefits**
9. **Gain on the sale of a personal residence** excluded from gross income under section 121 ($250,000/$500,000 exclusion)
10. **Income from an active trade or business** in which the taxpayer materially participates (non-passive business income)
11. **Alaska Permanent Fund Dividends**
12. **Any item taken into account in determining self-employment income** that is subject to self-employment tax under section 1401(b)

---

### The Lesser-Of Calculation

The NIIT is calculated as **3.8% of the lesser of**:

**(a)** Your **net investment income** (from Form 8960, line 12), OR

**(b)** The **excess** of your **modified adjusted gross income (MAGI)** over the applicable **threshold amount** for your filing status (MAGI minus threshold; if zero or less, the NIIT is zero).

**Formula:**

```
NIIT = 0.038 x min(Net Investment Income, MAGI - Threshold)
```

**Why "lesser of"?** This ensures the tax applies only to the portion of income that is both (1) investment income and (2) in excess of the threshold. If your MAGI exceeds the threshold by $50,000 but you only have $30,000 of NII, you pay 3.8% on $30,000. Conversely, if you have $80,000 of NII but your MAGI exceeds the threshold by only $50,000, you pay 3.8% on $50,000.

---

### Part I: Net Investment Income (Lines 1-8)

This section identifies all categories of investment income.

| Line | Description | Source / Instruction |
|------|-------------|----------------------|
| **1** | Taxable interest | Form 1040, line 2b. Includes bank interest, bond interest, and other taxable interest. Does **not** include tax-exempt interest. |
| **2** | Annuities | Taxable portion of annuity income from non-qualified annuities. Does not include distributions from 401(k), IRA, or other qualified retirement plans. Enter the amount from Form 1040, line 4d attributable to non-qualified annuities only. |
| **3** | Rental, royalty, partnership, S corporation, trust income | Enter the amount from Schedule E that constitutes net investment income. See lines 4a-4b for adjustments. |
| **4a** | Net rental income, royalties, partnerships, S corporations, trusts | From Schedule E, Part I-IV. Enter the combined net income (or loss) from all Schedule E activities that produce investment income. Include rental real estate, royalties, partnership K-1 amounts, and S corporation K-1 amounts. |
| **4b** | Adjustment for net income or loss derived in the ordinary course of a **non-section 1411 trade or business** | This line is used to **remove** income/loss from a trade or business that is NOT subject to NIIT. Amounts to exclude include: (1) nonpassive net rental income of a qualifying real estate professional where the rental rises to a section 162 trade or business; (2) net rental income that is nonpassive because it was grouped with an active trade or business; (3) other rental or business income from a section 162 trade or business reported on Schedule K-1 that is not passive; (4) net income recharacterized as not from a passive activity under section 469 self-rental rules, if derived in the ordinary course of a section 162 trade or business. |
| **4c** | Combine lines 4a and 4b | Net rental/royalty/pass-through income subject to NIIT. |
| **5a** | Net gain or loss from disposition of property | From Schedule D (Form 1040) and/or Form 4797. Includes capital gains and losses from sale of investment assets. |
| **5b** | Net gain or loss from disposition of property that is **not** subject to NIIT | Remove gains/losses from dispositions of property held in an active trade or business in which the taxpayer materially participates (non-section 1411 property). Also remove gain excluded under section 121 (home sale exclusion). |
| **5c** | Adjustment from disposition of partnership interest or S corporation stock | Include any gains/losses from the sale of a partnership interest or S corporation stock that are attributable to the entity's investment assets or passive activities, after excluding any portion attributable to non-section 1411 trade or business assets. |
| **5d** | Combine lines 5a, 5b, and 5c | Net gain/loss from property dispositions subject to NIIT. |
| **6** | Adjustments to gain or loss from CFCs and PFICs | Include amounts from controlled foreign corporations (section 951(a) inclusions) and passive foreign investment companies (section 1291-1298) to the extent they constitute net investment income. See Regulations section 1.1411-10. |
| **7** | Other modifications to investment income | Other adjustments, including recapture amounts, adjustments for income in respect of a decedent (IRD), etc. See Regulations section 1.1411-10(c). |
| **8** | **Total investment income.** Add lines 1, 2, 3, 4c, 5d, 6, and 7 | This is your **gross investment income** before deductions. |

---

### Part II: Investment Expenses/Deductions (Lines 9-11)

This section subtracts deductions that are **properly allocable** to investment income.

| Line | Description | Source / Instruction |
|------|-------------|----------------------|
| **9a** | Investment interest expense | From Schedule A, line 14, or Form 4952, line 8. This is the investment interest expense deduction allowed for the year. Only the portion allocable to net investment income is entered here. |
| **9b** | State, local, and foreign income tax | Enter only the portion of state, local, and foreign income taxes that is **properly allocable to net investment income**. You may use any reasonable method to determine this allocation. A common method: (Line 8 / Form 1040, line 15) x total state/local taxes paid. Note: Under TCJA, the $10,000 SALT deduction cap on Schedule A does NOT limit the amount on this line -- Form 8960 uses the actual tax allocable to investment income. |
| **9c** | Miscellaneous investment expenses | Investment advisory fees, brokerage fees, tax preparation fees related to investment income, and other expenses directly connected to the production of investment income. Note: Even though miscellaneous itemized deductions subject to the 2% floor are suspended for regular tax under TCJA, they may still be deductible here for NIIT purposes. |
| **9d** | Add lines 9a, 9b, and 9c | Total deductions from lines 9a-9c. |
| **10** | Additional modifications | Other properly allocable deductions per Regulations sections 1.1411-4(f)-(g). May include: penalty on early withdrawal of savings (Form 1040, Schedule 1, line 18), rental and royalty expenses already netted in Part I, and fiduciary expenses for estates/trusts. |
| **11** | **Total deductions and modifications.** Add lines 9d and 10 | Total deductions properly allocable to investment income. |

---

### Line 12: Net Investment Income

| Line | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **12** | **Subtract line 11 from line 8.** If the result is zero or less, enter **0**. | This is your **net investment income (NII)**. |

This is the key figure used in the Part III lesser-of calculation.

---

### Part III: Tax Computation -- Individuals (Lines 13-17)

| Line | Description | Source / Instruction |
|------|-------------|----------------------|
| **13** | Modified adjusted gross income (MAGI) | For most individuals: your AGI from Form 1040, line 11. If you excluded foreign earned income under section 911, add back the excluded amount (Form 2555, line 42) and subtract allocable deductions (Form 2555, line 44). If no section 911 exclusion and no CFC/PFIC adjustments, MAGI = AGI. |
| **14** | Threshold amount based on filing status | $250,000 (MFJ/QSS), $200,000 (Single/HoH), $125,000 (MFS). |
| **15** | Subtract line 14 from line 13 | If zero or less, enter **0**. This is the **excess of MAGI over the threshold**. |
| **16** | **Enter the smaller of line 12 or line 15** | This is the **taxable base** for NIIT. This implements the "lesser of" calculation. |
| **17** | **Net Investment Income Tax.** Multiply line 16 by **0.038** (3.8%) | This is your NIIT liability. Enter on Schedule 2 (Form 1040), line 18. |

### Part III: Tax Computation -- Estates & Trusts (Lines 18-21)

For estates and trusts (not individuals), the calculation differs:

| Line | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **18a** | Net investment income from line 12 |
| **18b** | Deductions for distributions of net investment income and deductions under section 642(c) (charitable deductions) |
| **18c** | **Undistributed net investment income.** Subtract line 18b from line 18a. |
| **19a** | Adjusted gross income (section 67(e)) |
| **19b** | Highest income tax bracket threshold for estates and trusts for the tax year (2025: $15,650) |
| **19c** | Subtract line 19b from line 19a. If zero or less, enter 0. |
| **20** | Enter the smaller of line 18c or line 19c |
| **21** | **Net Investment Income Tax.** Multiply line 20 by 0.038 (3.8%) |

### Modified Adjusted Gross Income (MAGI)

For purposes of NIIT (Form 8960), MAGI equals:

**MAGI = AGI + Foreign Earned Income Exclusion adjustments**

Specifically:
- Start with your AGI from Form 1040, line 11.
- **Add back** any amounts excluded from gross income under section 911(a)(1) (foreign earned income exclusion) -- from Form 2555, line 42.
- **Subtract** any deductions or exclusions disallowed under section 911(d)(6) with respect to the amounts excluded -- from Form 2555, line 44.
- If you have **CFC or PFIC** income, additional modifications may apply under Regulations section 1.1411-10(e).

**If you did not claim the foreign earned income exclusion and do not own CFCs or PFICs, your MAGI is simply your AGI from Form 1040, line 11.**

### Properly Allocable Deductions

Deductions that may be properly allocable to gross investment income under Regulations sections 1.1411-4(f)-(g) include:

- **Investment interest expense** (section 163(d))
- **Investment advisory and brokerage fees**
- **Expenses related to rental and royalty income** (already reflected in Schedule E net income)
- **Tax preparation fees** (to the extent allocable to investment income)
- **Fiduciary expenses** (for estates and trusts)
- **State, local, and foreign income taxes** (to the extent properly allocable to net investment income)
- **Penalty on early withdrawal of savings**

**Allocation method:** If a deduction is allocable to both net investment income and excluded income, you may use any **reasonable method** to determine the portion properly allocable to net investment income.

**Important TCJA note:** The SALT deduction cap ($10,000) and suspension of miscellaneous itemized deductions (2% floor) under TCJA affect the regular income tax calculation on Schedule A, but the IRS has stated that properly allocable deductions for NIIT purposes on Form 8960 are determined under section 1411 regulations, not Schedule A limitations. Taxpayers should consult Regulations section 1.1411-4 for detailed guidance.

### Special Rules: Controlled Foreign Corporations (CFCs) and Passive Foreign Investment Companies (PFICs)

- If you are a United States shareholder of a CFC or a direct or indirect shareholder of a PFIC, you may need to include certain amounts in your net investment income.
- **CFC inclusions** under section 951(a) and **PFIC mark-to-market gains** under section 1296 may be included in net investment income.
- The rules are detailed in **Regulations section 1.1411-10**.
- Adjustments for CFC/PFIC income are entered on **line 6** (Part I) and may also affect MAGI on **line 13** (Part III).
- Taxpayers with CFC/PFIC holdings should review the detailed instructions and regulations carefully.

### Where Form 8960 Flows to Form 1040

| Form 8960 Line | Flows To |
|----------------|----------|
| Line 17 (NIIT for individuals) | Schedule 2 (Form 1040), line 18. Then to Form 1040, line 23 (total tax). |
| Line 21 (NIIT for estates/trusts) | Form 1041, Schedule G, line 4. |

The NIIT is reported as an **additional tax** and is not subject to estimated tax penalty safe harbors separately -- it is included in your total tax for estimated tax purposes.

## Comparison: Form 8959 vs. Form 8960

| Feature | Form 8959 (Additional Medicare Tax) | Form 8960 (NIIT) |
|---------|-------------------------------------|-------------------|
| **Tax rate** | 0.9% | 3.8% |
| **Applies to** | Medicare wages, SE income, RRTA compensation | Net investment income (interest, dividends, capital gains, rental, etc.) |
| **Does NOT apply to** | Investment income | Wages, SE income, Social Security, retirement distributions |
| **MFJ threshold** | $250,000 | $250,000 |
| **Single/HoH threshold** | $200,000 | $200,000 |
| **MFS threshold** | $125,000 | $125,000 |
| **Thresholds indexed?** | No | No (individuals). Yes (estates/trusts). |
| **Calculation basis** | 0.9% of earnings above threshold | 3.8% of lesser of NII or (MAGI - threshold) |
| **Employer withholding?** | Yes (at $200,000 regardless of status) | No -- no withholding mechanism |
| **Applies to estates/trusts?** | No | Yes |
| **Where reported** | Schedule 2, line 23 | Schedule 2, line 18 |
| **Enacted by** | ACA (section 3101(b)(2)) | ACA (section 1411) |

### Combined Surtax Impact for High-Income Taxpayers

A taxpayer with both high earned income and investment income may owe **both** taxes:

- **0.9%** on wages/SE income above threshold (Form 8959)
- **3.8%** on net investment income (or MAGI excess) (Form 8960)

However, the same dollar of income is never subject to both taxes simultaneously. Wages are subject to the 0.9% Additional Medicare Tax but are excluded from NII. Investment income is subject to the 3.8% NIIT but is excluded from the 0.9% Additional Medicare Tax.

The practical effect is that high-income taxpayers pay a surtax on income above the thresholds regardless of whether that income is earned (0.9%) or investment (3.8%).
