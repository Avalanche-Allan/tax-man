## 1. Overview

Publication 502 explains the itemized deduction for medical and dental expenses claimed
on Schedule A (Form 1040). It covers what expenses qualify, whose expenses can be
included, how to calculate the deduction, and interactions with health savings accounts
(HSAs) and self-employed health insurance.

---

## 2. The 7.5% AGI Floor

Medical and dental expenses are deductible only to the extent they exceed **7.5% of adjusted gross income (AGI)**.

### Calculation

```
1. Total qualifying medical and dental expenses paid during 2025
2. Minus: Reimbursements received (insurance, HSA distributions, etc.)
3. = Net medical expenses
4. Minus: 7.5% of AGI (Form 1040, line 11 x 0.075)
5. = Deductible medical expenses (Schedule A, line 4)
```

### Example

| Item | Amount |
|------|--------|
| AGI | $80,000 |
| Total medical expenses | $9,000 |
| 7.5% of AGI ($80,000 x 0.075) | $6,000 |
| **Deductible amount** | **$3,000** |

> **Note:** The 7.5% threshold is permanent (made permanent by the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021). There is no scheduled increase to 10%.

## 3. Whose Expenses Qualify

You can include medical expenses paid for:

- **Yourself**
- **Your spouse** (at the time services were provided or the time of payment)
- **Your dependents** (at the time services were provided or the time of payment)
- **A person who would qualify as your dependent** except that:
  - They filed a joint return,
  - They had gross income of $5,150 or more (2025), or
  - They could be claimed as a dependent on someone else's return

The key test is the relationship and support test, not whether you actually claimed the person as a dependent.

## 7. Self-Employed Health Insurance Deduction

### Above-the-Line Deduction (Not Schedule A)

Self-employed individuals may deduct 100% of health insurance premiums paid for themselves, their spouse, and their dependents as an **above-the-line deduction** on **Schedule 1, line 17** (adjustment to income). This deduction is taken **instead of** claiming the same premiums on Schedule A.

### Eligibility

- You must have net self-employment income (Schedule C profit) for the year.
- You must not be eligible to participate in a subsidized health plan through an employer (yours or your spouse's).
- The deduction cannot exceed the net profit from the business for which the insurance plan was established.
- Coverage must be established under the business (in your name or the business name).

### What Is Deductible

- Medical insurance premiums
- Dental insurance premiums
- Qualified long-term care insurance premiums (subject to age-based limits in Section 5)
- Medicare premiums (Part B, Part D, Medigap)

### Interaction with Schedule A

- Premiums deducted on Schedule 1 **cannot** also be included in the medical expense deduction on Schedule A.
- Any premiums that exceed the self-employed health insurance deduction limit (e.g., net SE income) may be included on Schedule A, subject to the 7.5% AGI floor.
- The self-employed health insurance deduction reduces AGI, which in turn affects the 7.5% threshold calculation for any remaining medical expenses on Schedule A.

### Interaction with Premium Tax Credit

- The self-employed health insurance deduction and the premium tax credit (Form 8962) interact because both depend on AGI. An iterative calculation may be required.

---

## 8. Health Savings Account (HSA) Interaction

### HSA Contributions

- Contributions to an HSA are deducted on **Schedule 1, line 13** (above-the-line deduction), **not** as medical expenses on Schedule A.
- 2025 contribution limits: **$4,300** (self-only) / **$8,550** (family). Additional **$1,000** catch-up contribution for age 55+.
- Must be enrolled in a **High Deductible Health Plan (HDHP)** to contribute.

### HSA Distributions

- Distributions used for **qualified medical expenses** are tax-free.
- Expenses paid with HSA funds **cannot** also be deducted on Schedule A (no double benefit).
- Distributions not used for qualified medical expenses are included in income and subject to a **20% penalty** (unless age 65+, disabled, or deceased).

### Coordination with Medical Expense Deduction

- If you pay medical expenses with after-tax (non-HSA) funds, those amounts may be included in your Schedule A medical expense deduction.
- If you pay medical expenses with HSA funds, those amounts are **excluded** from the Schedule A deduction (already received tax-free treatment).

---

## 9. Reimbursements and Insurance

### General Rule

You must reduce your total medical expenses by all reimbursements received during the tax year, regardless of when the expenses were incurred.

### Sources of Reimbursement

- Health insurance payouts
- HSA, HRA, or FSA distributions for medical expenses
- Accident or health plan reimbursements
- Lawsuit settlements or awards for medical expenses
- Workers' compensation for medical costs

### Timing of Reimbursement

- **Reimbursement received in the same year as the expense:** Reduce the expense by the reimbursement before calculating the deduction.
- **Reimbursement received in a later year:** If you deducted the expense in a prior year, include the reimbursement in gross income in the year received to the extent of the prior tax benefit (tax benefit rule). Report on Form 1040, Schedule 1 as "Other income."
- **Excess reimbursement** (more than the expense): The excess is generally taxable income.

### Flexible Spending Arrangements (FSA)

- Amounts contributed to a health FSA through salary reduction are pre-tax and reduce your medical expenses for Schedule A purposes.
- Expenses reimbursed by an FSA cannot be included in your Schedule A medical expense deduction.
