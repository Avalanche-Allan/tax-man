## Overview - Section 199A Deduction

The **Section 199A Qualified Business Income (QBI) Deduction** allows eligible taxpayers to deduct up to **20% of their qualified business income** from domestic trades or businesses operated as sole proprietorships, partnerships, S corporations, trusts, or estates. It also provides for a deduction of up to 20% of qualified REIT dividends and qualified publicly traded partnership (PTP) income.

This deduction is sometimes called the "pass-through deduction" because it benefits owners of pass-through entities and sole proprietors. It does NOT apply to income from C corporations or to the trade or business of performing services as an employee (W-2 wages received as an employee do not generate QBI).

The deduction is taken on the individual's tax return as a deduction from taxable income (it reduces taxable income but NOT adjusted gross income). It is available regardless of whether the taxpayer itemizes deductions or takes the standard deduction.

### Who Can Claim the Deduction

- Individuals (including sole proprietors)
- Trusts and estates
- Partners in partnerships (including LLCs taxed as partnerships)
- Shareholders in S corporations
- Beneficiaries of trusts and estates with QBI passed through

### Who Cannot Claim the Deduction

- C corporations
- Employees (W-2 income is NOT QBI)
- Taxpayers with no QBI, qualified REIT dividends, or qualified PTP income

---

## Which Form to Use: 8995 vs 8995-A

### Form 8995 (Simplified Computation)

Use Form 8995 if ALL of the following are true:

1. You have qualified business income, qualified REIT dividends, or qualified PTP income or loss
2. Your 2025 taxable income **before** the QBI deduction is **at or below**:
   - **$197,300** (Single, Head of Household, Married Filing Separately)
   - **$394,600** (Married Filing Jointly)
3. You are **NOT** a patron of an agricultural or horticultural cooperative

### Form 8995-A (Full Computation)

Use Form 8995-A if ANY of the following are true:

1. Your 2025 taxable income before the QBI deduction **exceeds**:
   - **$197,300** (Single, HoH, MFS)
   - **$394,600** (MFJ)
2. You are a patron of an agricultural or horticultural cooperative
3. You have QBI from a trade or business that is a specified service trade or business (SSTB) and your taxable income exceeds the thresholds
4. You choose to aggregate trades or businesses

**Key Difference**: Below the threshold, no W-2 wage or UBIA limitations apply, and SSTB status is irrelevant. The simplified form avoids all those calculations.

---

## The 20% QBI Deduction

The core deduction is straightforward:

> **QBI Deduction = 20% x Qualified Business Income**

However, this amount is subject to multiple limitations:

1. **W-2 Wage / UBIA Limitation** (only applies above taxable income thresholds)
2. **SSTB Exclusion/Phase-Out** (only applies above taxable income thresholds)
3. **Overall Cap**: The deduction cannot exceed **20% of taxable income** (minus net capital gain)

### Deduction Formula (Full)

The Section 199A deduction equals the **lesser** of:

**(A)** The combined QBI amount, which is the sum of:
- The **QBI component**: The lesser of 20% of QBI from each qualified trade or business OR the greater of:
  - 50% of W-2 wages paid by the qualified trade or business, OR
  - 25% of W-2 wages PLUS 2.5% of the UBIA of qualified property
- PLUS the **REIT/PTP component**: 20% of qualified REIT dividends plus qualified PTP income

**(B)** **20% of taxable income** (minus net capital gain, including qualified dividend income)

---

## 2025 Taxable Income Thresholds

These thresholds are indexed for inflation annually.

| Filing Status | Lower Threshold | Upper Threshold (Phase-Out End) | Phase-In Range |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Married Filing Jointly (MFJ)** | $394,600 | $494,600 | $100,000 |
| **Single** | $197,300 | $247,300 | $50,000 |
| **Head of Household** | $197,300 | $247,300 | $50,000 |
| **Married Filing Separately (MFS)** | $197,300 | $247,300 | $50,000 |

> **Note**: Under the OBBBA (effective for tax years beginning after 12/31/2025), the phase-in ranges increase to $150,000 (MFJ) and $75,000 (all others), indexed for inflation after 2026. For the **2025 tax year**, the original TCJA phase-in ranges of $100,000/$50,000 still apply.

### What the Thresholds Mean

- **At or Below Lower Threshold**: Full 20% deduction with NO W-2 wage/UBIA limitations and NO SSTB restrictions. Use Form 8995 (simplified).
- **Between Lower and Upper Threshold (Phase-In Range)**: W-2 wage/UBIA limitations are phased in. SSTB income is partially excluded (phased out). Use Form 8995-A.
- **Above Upper Threshold**: Full W-2 wage/UBIA limitations apply. SSTB income is **completely excluded** (no deduction for SSTBs). Use Form 8995-A.

## What Qualifies as QBI

**Qualified Business Income (QBI)** is the net amount of qualified items of income, gain, deduction, and loss from any **qualified trade or business** that are effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business within the United States.

### Qualified Items of Income Include:

- Ordinary business income or loss (from trade or business activities)
- Section 1231 gains/losses (to the extent treated as ordinary income)
- Net rental income (if the rental activity rises to the level of a trade or business)
- Guaranteed payments for the use of capital by a partnership (to the partner)
- Income from self-employment (sole proprietorship)

### What Constitutes a Qualified Trade or Business

A **qualified trade or business** is any trade or business under IRC Section 162, EXCEPT:

1. The trade or business of performing services as an **employee**
2. A **specified service trade or business (SSTB)** for taxpayers above the income thresholds

Trades or businesses that qualify include:
- Sole proprietorships (reported on Schedule C)
- Partnerships / LLCs (income reported on Schedule K-1, Form 1065)
- S corporations (income reported on Schedule K-1, Form 1120-S)
- Rental real estate enterprises (if they meet the trade or business standard or safe harbor)
- Certain trusts and estates

---

## QBI Sources

### Schedule C (Form 1040) - Sole Proprietorship Income

Net profit or loss from Schedule C flows directly into the QBI calculation. The taxpayer reports the business name, EIN/SSN, and the QBI amount on Form 8995, Line 1.

**Adjustments to Schedule C income for QBI purposes:**
- Subtract the deductible portion of self-employment tax (50% of SE tax)
- Subtract self-employed health insurance deduction
- Subtract deductions for contributions to qualified retirement plans (SEP-IRA, SIMPLE IRA, solo 401(k))

These are treated as deductions allocable to the qualified trade or business and reduce QBI.

### Schedule K-1 (Form 1065) - Partnership/LLC Income

- **Box 1**: Ordinary business income (loss) - generally included in QBI
- **Box 2-13**: Various items that may or may not be QBI depending on character
- **Box 20, Code Z**: **Section 199A information** - This is the critical box. The partnership/LLC reports the partner's share of QBI, W-2 wages, UBIA of qualified property, and SSTB status via an attached statement (STMT). This statement typically includes:
  - Qualified business income (loss)
  - W-2 wages allocable to QBI
  - UBIA of qualified property
  - Whether the activity is an SSTB
  - Qualified REIT dividends
  - Qualified PTP income
  - Section 199A dividends

### Schedule K-1 (Form 1120-S) - S Corporation Income

- **Box 1**: Ordinary business income (loss) - generally included in QBI
- **Box 17, Code V**: **Section 199A information** - Same concept as K-1 Box 20 Code Z for partnerships. The S corporation reports QBI, W-2 wages, UBIA, and SSTB status via an attached statement.

### Other Sources

- **Form 1099-DIV, Box 5**: Qualified REIT dividends (Section 199A dividends)
- **Schedule E**: Rental income (if the activity qualifies as a trade or business)
- **Schedule F**: Farm income (qualified for QBI)

---

## Items Excluded from QBI

The following items are **NOT** included in QBI:

1. **Capital gains and losses** (short-term and long-term, including Section 1231 capital gains)
2. **Dividends and dividend equivalents** (including qualified dividends)
3. **Interest income** not properly allocable to a trade or business
4. **Commodities gains/losses** or foreign currency gains/losses under Sections 954(c)(1)(C) or (D)
5. **Income from an annuity** not received in connection with a trade or business
6. **Reasonable compensation** paid by an S corporation to its shareholder-employees (this is W-2 income, not QBI)
7. **Guaranteed payments** for services to a partner (these are treated like wages)
8. **Payments under Section 707(a)** to a partner for services rendered
9. **Items not effectively connected** with the conduct of a trade or business in the US
10. **Qualified REIT dividends** and **qualified PTP income** (these have their own separate component)
11. **Income earned as an employee** (W-2 wages)

### Special Note on Guaranteed Payments

- Guaranteed payments **for services** to a partner: **EXCLUDED** from QBI (treated like wages)
- Guaranteed payments **for the use of capital**: Treatment depends on whether they are properly allocable to the trade or business. The partnership's deduction for the payment may reduce the partnership's QBI.

## Specified Service Trades or Businesses (SSTBs)

An SSTB is any trade or business involving the performance of services in the following fields:

### SSTB Fields (Per IRC Section 199A(d)(2) and Reg. Section 1.199A-5)

| Field | Description |

| **Any Trade or Business Where the Principal Asset is the Reputation or Skill of One or More Employees or Owners** | Endorsement income, licensing of name/likeness, appearance fees (narrowly defined in regulations) |

### Fields Specifically EXCLUDED from SSTB Definition

- **Engineering** - Expressly excluded
- **Architecture** - Expressly excluded
- **Real estate agents/brokers** - Not considered brokerage services for SSTB purposes
- **Insurance agents/brokers** - Not considered brokerage services for SSTB purposes
- **Banking** (traditional lending/deposit services) - Distinguished from financial services/investment management

### De Minimis Rule for SSTBs

If a trade or business has **both** SSTB and non-SSTB activities:
- If gross receipts are **$25 million or less**: The business is NOT an SSTB if the SSTB portion is **less than 10%** of gross receipts
- If gross receipts are **more than $25 million**: The business is NOT an SSTB if the SSTB portion is **less than 5%** of gross receipts
- If the SSTB portion exceeds these thresholds, the **entire** business is treated as an SSTB

### Common Ownership SSTB Rule

If your non-SSTB trade or business provides services or property to an SSTB, and there is **50% or more common ownership** of the two businesses, the portion of the non-SSTB business that provides services/property to the SSTB is treated as a **separate SSTB** with respect to the common owners.

---

## SSTB Phase-Out Rules

### Below the Lower Threshold

If taxable income (before QBI deduction) is **at or below** $197,300 (single) / $394,600 (MFJ):
- SSTB status is **irrelevant** - the business is treated as a qualified trade or business
- Full 20% QBI deduction is available
- No W-2 wage or UBIA limitations apply

### Within the Phase-In Range

If taxable income is **between** the lower and upper thresholds:

| Filing Status | Phase-In Range |
|---|---|
| Single / HoH / MFS | $197,300 - $247,300 |
| MFJ | $394,600 - $494,600 |

An **applicable percentage** is calculated to determine how much of the SSTB's QBI, W-2 wages, and UBIA are included:

```
Phase-In Percentage = (Taxable Income - Lower Threshold) / Phase-In Range ($50,000 or $100,000)
Applicable Percentage = 100% - Phase-In Percentage
```

**Example (Single filer, taxable income $222,300):**
```
Phase-In % = ($222,300 - $197,300) / $50,000 = $25,000 / $50,000 = 50%
Applicable % = 100% - 50% = 50%
```
Only 50% of the SSTB's QBI, W-2 wages, and UBIA are taken into account.

### Above the Upper Threshold

If taxable income **exceeds** $247,300 (single) / $494,600 (MFJ):
- **ZERO** QBI, W-2 wages, or UBIA from the SSTB is taken into account
- The SSTB generates **NO** Section 199A deduction whatsoever

### Form 8995-A, Schedule A (Specified Service Trades or Businesses)

Schedule A is used to calculate the applicable percentage and reduce the SSTB's QBI, W-2 wages, and UBIA when taxable income falls within the phase-in range. The reduced amounts are then carried to Form 8995-A, Part I for the W-2 wage/UBIA limitation calculation.

---

## W-2 Wage Limitation

**Applies only when taxable income exceeds the threshold** ($197,300 single / $394,600 MFJ).

For each qualified trade or business, the QBI deduction component is limited to the **greater** of:

**(A)** 50% of W-2 wages paid by the qualified trade or business, **OR**

**(B)** 25% of W-2 wages PLUS 2.5% of the UBIA of qualified property

If taxable income is **within** the phase-in range, the W-2 wage/UBIA limitation is phased in proportionally.

### Phase-In of W-2/UBIA Limitation

When taxable income falls within the phase-in range:

```
Reduction Ratio = (Taxable Income - Lower Threshold) / Phase-In Range
Excess Amount = 20% of QBI - W-2/UBIA Limitation Amount
QBI Component = 20% of QBI - (Excess Amount x Reduction Ratio)
```

### Definition of W-2 Wages

W-2 wages for Section 199A purposes include:
- Total wages as defined in Section 3401(a)
- Plus elective deferrals (Section 402(g)(3))
- Plus compensation deferred under Section 457
- Plus designated Roth contributions (Section 402A)

**Only wages properly allocable** to QBI are considered. Wages must have been:
- Paid by the qualified trade or business
- Included on a W-2 filed with the Social Security Administration (SSA) within 60 days of the filing deadline

### Three Calculation Methods for W-2 Wages

1. **Unmodified Box Method**: The lesser of total Box 1 (wages, tips, other compensation) or total Box 5 (Medicare wages and tips) from all Forms W-2 filed with SSA
2. **Modified Box 1 Method**: Total Box 1, modified by subtracting amounts that don't qualify as wages (e.g., supplemental unemployment compensation benefits)
3. **Tracking Wages Method**: Starting with total wages subject to federal income tax withholding, plus retirement plan elective deferrals (Box 12 codes D, E, F, G, and S)

### Sole Proprietors and W-2 Wages

A sole proprietor with no employees has **$0 W-2 wages** for this purpose (the sole proprietor's own self-employment income is NOT W-2 wages). This means the W-2 wage limitation can significantly reduce or eliminate the deduction for high-income sole proprietors with no employees and no qualified property.

---

## UBIA of Qualified Property Limitation

**UBIA** = Unadjusted Basis Immediately After Acquisition

### Definition of Qualified Property

**Qualified property** is tangible property of a character subject to depreciation under Section 167 that:

1. Is **held by and available for use** in the qualified trade or business at the close of the taxable year
2. Is **used at any point** during the taxable year in the trade or business's production of QBI
3. Has a **depreciable period** that has NOT ended before the close of the taxable year

### UBIA Amount

The UBIA of qualified property is the **cost basis** of the property under Section 1012 at the time of acquisition, **without any reduction** for depreciation. It remains the original cost regardless of subsequent depreciation deductions.

### Depreciable Period

The depreciable period begins on the date the property was first placed in service and ends on the **later** of:
- **10 years** after the date placed in service, OR
- The last day of the last full year in the applicable **recovery period** under Section 168 (MACRS), determined without regard to the alternative depreciation system (ADS)

**Example**: 39-year nonresidential real property placed in service on January 1, 2010:
- 10-year period ends: December 31, 2019
- Recovery period ends: December 31, 2048
- Depreciable period ends: December 31, 2048 (later date)

### Combined W-2/UBIA Limitation Formula

For each trade or business, the QBI component cannot exceed the **greater** of:

```
Option A: 50% of W-2 wages

Option B: 25% of W-2 wages + 2.5% of UBIA of qualified property
```

If both Option A and Option B equal zero (no W-2 wages and no qualified property), then the QBI component for that business is **$0** when above the threshold.

---

## The 20% of Taxable Income Cap

Regardless of all other calculations, the total QBI deduction cannot exceed:

> **20% of Taxable Income** (minus net capital gain)

### Calculation

```
Taxable Income Cap = 20% x (Taxable Income - Net Capital Gain)
```

Where **net capital gain** = net long-term capital gain over net short-term capital loss + qualified dividend income.

### Application

The final QBI deduction is the **lesser** of:
1. The combined QBI amount (QBI component + REIT/PTP component)
2. 20% of taxable income (minus net capital gain)

This cap ensures the deduction does not reduce the taxpayer's effective rate on business income below their rate on investment income.

---

## REIT Dividends and PTP Income

The REIT/PTP component is calculated **separately** from the QBI component and is **NOT subject to W-2 wage or UBIA limitations**.

### Qualified REIT Dividends

Include dividends from a REIT if:
- The REIT shares were held for **more than 45 days** (91 days for preferred stock dividends for periods greater than 366 days)
- The payment is not obligated to someone else
- The dividend is NOT a capital gain dividend or qualified dividend

Reported on **Form 1099-DIV, Box 5** (Section 199A dividends).

Also includes qualified REIT dividends received through a regulated investment company (RIC/mutual fund).

### Qualified PTP Income

Includes the taxpayer's share of qualified items of income, gain, deduction, and loss from a **publicly traded partnership** (PTP) that is not treated as a corporation. May also include gain or loss on disposition of a PTP interest (to the extent not treated as capital gain/loss).

**Important**: If the PTP is an SSTB and the taxpayer is above the threshold, the SSTB phase-out rules apply to the PTP income as well.

### REIT/PTP Component

```
REIT/PTP Component = 20% x (Qualified REIT Dividends + Qualified PTP Income)
```

If the combined qualified REIT dividends and PTP income is negative (a net loss), the REIT/PTP component is $0 for the current year. The loss carries forward to offset future REIT/PTP income.

---

## Loss Netting and Carryforward Rules

### Current Year Loss Netting

If you have multiple qualified trades or businesses and some have **negative QBI** (losses) while others have **positive QBI**:

1. Net all positive and negative QBI amounts together
2. If the total is **positive**, proceed with the 20% calculation
3. If the total is **zero or negative**, the QBI component is **$0** for the year

When negative QBI offsets positive QBI, the loss is allocated **proportionally** among all businesses with positive QBI based on their relative share of total positive QBI.

### Prior Year Loss Carryforward

If the total QBI for all businesses is **negative** in a year:

- The negative amount carries forward to the **next tax year**
- It is treated as arising from a **separate trade or business** in the carryforward year
- The loss carries forward **indefinitely** until completely offset by positive QBI
- **W-2 wages and UBIA of qualified property do NOT carry forward** with the loss

### Form 8995-A, Schedule C (Loss Netting and Carryforward)

Schedule C must be completed if:
- Any trade or business has a qualified business loss in the current year, OR
- There is a qualified business net loss carryforward from prior years

The schedule offsets losses against income and calculates any carryforward to the next year.

### Important: Previously Suspended Losses

Losses that were previously suspended under other Code sections (e.g., passive activity loss rules under Section 469, basis limitations under Section 704(d), at-risk limitations under Section 465, excess business loss limitations under Section 461(l)) do NOT generate QBI in the year they arise. Instead, they reduce QBI in the year they are **allowed as deductions**.

---

## Aggregation of Businesses

Taxpayers may elect to aggregate multiple qualified trades or businesses into a single trade or business for purposes of calculating the QBI deduction.

### Why Aggregate?

Aggregation can be beneficial because:
- It allows **sharing** of W-2 wages and UBIA of qualified property among entities
- A business with high QBI but low W-2 wages can be combined with a business that has significant W-2 wages
- It eliminates the loss netting process and its proportional allocation

### Aggregation Requirements (All Must Be Met)

1. **Common Ownership**: The same person or group of persons, directly or indirectly, must own **50% or more** of each trade or business for a majority of the tax year, including the last day of the tax year

2. **Same Tax Year End**: All trades or businesses in the aggregation must use the same tax year end

3. **No SSTBs**: None of the aggregated trades or businesses can be an SSTB (SSTBs cannot be aggregated with non-SSTBs)

4. **At Least Two of Three Operational Integration Factors**:
   - (a) The businesses provide **products, property, or services** that are the same or customarily offered together
   - (b) The businesses **share facilities** or share significant centralized business elements (personnel, accounting, legal, manufacturing, purchasing, human resources, IT, etc.)
   - (c) The businesses are operated in **coordination with, or reliance upon**, one or more of the other businesses in the aggregated group

### Reporting Requirements

- Aggregation is reported on **Form 8995-A, Schedule B**
- The election must be made in the **first year** the businesses are aggregated
- **Consistency**: Once made, the aggregation must be reported consistently in all subsequent years unless there is a significant change in facts and circumstances
- New businesses can be added to an existing aggregation if they meet the requirements

### Combined Amounts for Aggregated Businesses

When aggregated, the following are combined for the group:
- QBI (all businesses summed)
- W-2 wages (all businesses summed)
- UBIA of qualified property (all businesses summed)

The W-2 wage/UBIA limitation is then applied to the **combined** amounts.

---

## Rental Real Estate Safe Harbor

### General Rule

Rental real estate income can qualify as QBI if the rental activity constitutes a **trade or business** under Section 162. Whether a rental activity rises to the level of a trade or business depends on the facts and circumstances.

### Revenue Procedure 2019-38 Safe Harbor

The IRS provides a safe harbor under which a **rental real estate enterprise** is automatically treated as a trade or business for Section 199A purposes if all of the following are met:

1. **Separate books and records** are maintained for each rental real estate enterprise

2. **250 or more hours** of rental services are performed per year for the enterprise. Qualifying rental services include:
   - Advertising to rent or lease the real estate
   - Negotiating and executing leases
   - Verifying information in prospective tenant applications
   - Collection of rent
   - Daily operation, maintenance, and repair of the property
   - Management of the real estate
   - Purchase of materials
   - Supervision of employees and independent contractors

3. **Contemporaneous records** including time reports, logs, or similar documents are maintained regarding:
   - Hours of all services performed
   - Description of all services performed
   - Dates on which such services were performed
   - Who performed the services

**Note**: The 250-hour requirement does NOT include:
- Travel time
- Time spent arranging financing
- Time spent procuring property
- Time spent studying or reviewing financial statements or reports on operations

### Exclusions from Safe Harbor

The safe harbor does **NOT** apply to:
- Real estate used by the taxpayer as a residence
- Real estate rented or leased under a **triple net lease** (tenant pays taxes, insurance, and maintenance)

### If Safe Harbor Is Not Met

Even if the safe harbor is not met, rental income may still qualify as QBI if the taxpayer can demonstrate the rental activity constitutes a trade or business based on all facts and circumstances (case law standard).

---

  - Phase-in calculation when income is in the phase-in range

**Part III: Phased-In Reduction**

## OBBBA 2025 Changes - Made Permanent

The **One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA)**, signed into law on July 4, 2025, made significant changes to Section 199A:

### Key Changes (Effective for Tax Years Beginning After 12/31/2025)

1. **Permanence**: The QBI deduction is made **permanent**. The original TCJA sunset date of December 31, 2025 is removed. IRC Section 199A(i) expiration is eliminated.

2. **Expanded Phase-In Ranges**: The phase-in ranges are increased:
   - MFJ: Increased from $100,000 to **$150,000**
   - Single/HoH/MFS: Increased from $50,000 to **$75,000**
   - These expanded ranges are **indexed for inflation** after 2026

3. **New $400 Minimum Deduction**: If the taxpayer's aggregate QBI from all **active** qualified trades or businesses (material participation required) is at least **$1,000**, the taxpayer receives a minimum deduction of **$400** (or the regular calculated deduction, whichever is greater). The $400 amount is indexed for inflation after 2026.

4. **Deduction Rate Maintained**: The 20% deduction rate is unchanged.

### For the 2025 Tax Year

The 2025 tax year uses the **original TCJA rules** (the OBBBA changes take effect for tax years beginning after 12/31/2025, meaning 2026 and beyond for calendar-year taxpayers). This means:
- Phase-in ranges remain $50,000 (single) / $100,000 (MFJ) for 2025
- No $400 minimum deduction for 2025
- Thresholds for 2025: $197,300 (single) / $394,600 (MFJ)
