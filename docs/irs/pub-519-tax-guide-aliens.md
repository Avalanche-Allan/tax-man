## 1. Resident vs. Nonresident Alien Determination

For U.S. tax purposes, an **alien** is any individual who is not a U.S. citizen. Aliens are classified as either **resident aliens** or **nonresident aliens (NRAs)**. This distinction is critical because:

- **Resident aliens** are taxed on **worldwide income** (same as U.S. citizens).
- **Nonresident aliens** are generally taxed only on **U.S.-source income**.

An alien is treated as a **resident alien** for a calendar year if they meet **either** of the following tests:

1. The **Green Card Test**, or
2. The **Substantial Presence Test**

If neither test is met, the individual is a **nonresident alien** (unless a special election applies).

---

## 2. The Green Card Test

You are a **resident alien** if at any time during the calendar year you are a **lawful permanent resident** of the United States under the immigration laws (i.e., you hold a green card).

### Key Rules

- Residency **begins** on the first day you are physically present in the United States as a lawful permanent resident.
- Residency **continues** as long as the status has not been officially revoked or administratively or judicially determined to have been abandoned.
- Merely filing Form I-407 (Record of Abandonment of Lawful Permanent Resident Status) or having the green card rescinded ends resident status.
- A green card holder who is also a resident of a treaty country may be treated as a **nonresident** under a treaty tie-breaker rule, but must file **Form 8833** to disclose the treaty-based position.

---

## 3. The Substantial Presence Test (183 Days Formula)

You are a **resident alien** if you meet the substantial presence test for the calendar year. To meet this test, you must be **physically present** in the United States on at least **31 days** during the current year **and** at least **183 days** during the **3-year period** that includes the current year and the 2 preceding years, using the following weighted formula:

### The Formula

| Year | Days Present | Weight | Weighted Days |
|---|---|---|---|
| Current year (2025) | X days | x **1** | X |
| Prior year (2024) | Y days | x **1/3** | Y/3 |
| Two years prior (2023) | Z days | x **1/6** | Z/6 |
| **Total weighted days** | | | **Must be >= 183** |

### Example

| Year | Actual Days | Weight | Weighted Days |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2025 | 120 days | x 1 | 120 |
| 2024 | 120 days | x 1/3 | 40 |
| 2023 | 120 days | x 1/6 | 20 |
| **Total** | | | **180 (not met)** |

In this example, the individual does **not** meet the substantial presence test despite spending 120 days in the U.S. each year.

### Days That Do NOT Count

The following days of physical presence are **excluded** from the count:

- Days you commute from Canada or Mexico to work in the U.S. (regular commuter)
- Days you are in the U.S. for **fewer than 24 hours** while in transit between two foreign countries
- Days you are unable to leave the U.S. due to a **medical condition** that arose while in the U.S.
- Days you are an **exempt individual** (foreign government-related individual, teacher/trainee under J or Q visa, student under F, J, M, or Q visa, professional athlete competing in a charitable event)

### Closer Connection Exception

Even if you meet the 183-day threshold, you are **not** treated as a resident if **all** of the following apply:

- You were present in the U.S. for **fewer than 183 days** during the current year.
- You maintained a **tax home** in a foreign country during the year.
- You had a **closer connection** to that foreign country than to the United States.

You must file **Form 8840** (Closer Connection Exception Statement) to claim this exception.

---

## 4. First-Year Choice Election

If you do **not** meet the green card test or substantial presence test for the current year, but you meet the substantial presence test in the **following year**, you may elect to be treated as a **resident alien** for part of the current year.

### Requirements

1. You were **not** a resident in the prior year.
2. You are a resident under the substantial presence test in the **following year**.
3. You are physically present in the U.S. for at least **31 consecutive days** in the current year.
4. You are physically present in the U.S. for at least **75%** of the days in the period beginning with the first day of the 31-consecutive-day period and ending on December 31 of the current year.

### Effect

- You are treated as a **dual-status alien** for the election year.
- Residency begins on the **first day of the 31-consecutive-day period** that you identify on the election.
- You are a nonresident alien for the portion of the year **before** the residency start date.

### How to Elect

Attach a statement to your Form 1040 for the election year (filed by the due date, including extensions). You must also file a Form 1040 (not 1040-NR) for the following year to prove you met the substantial presence test.

---

## 5. Dual-Status Aliens

A **dual-status alien** is an individual who is both a nonresident alien and a resident alien during the same tax year. This typically occurs in the year of arrival to or departure from the United States.

### Tax Treatment

| Portion of Year | Tax Status | Income Taxed |
|---|---|---|
| Nonresident portion | NRA rules | U.S.-source income only |
| Resident portion | Resident rules | Worldwide income |

### Filing Requirements

- File **Form 1040** for the year, with "Dual-Status Return" written across the top.
- Attach a **Form 1040-NR** as a statement for the nonresident portion, labeled "Dual-Status Statement."
- You **cannot** use the standard deduction for a dual-status year.
- You **cannot** file a joint return for a dual-status year (unless the Section 6013(g) or (h) election is made).
- You **cannot** use the Head of Household filing status for the nonresident portion.

### Residency Start/End Dates

- **Green card test:** Residency begins on the first day of physical presence as a lawful permanent resident.
- **Substantial presence test:** Residency begins on the first day of physical presence in the year the test is met.
- **Residency termination:** If you leave the U.S. and can show a closer connection to a foreign country for the remainder of the year, residency ends on the last day of physical presence.

## 6. NRA Spouse Election -- Section 6013(g)

A U.S. citizen or resident alien married to a **nonresident alien** may elect to treat the NRA spouse as a **resident alien** for the entire tax year, allowing them to file a **joint return**.

### Requirements

- At least one spouse must be a U.S. citizen or resident alien at the end of the tax year.
- Both spouses must agree to the election.
- Both spouses must have (or obtain) either an **SSN** or an **ITIN**.
- Attach a statement to the joint return declaring the election under Section 6013(g).

### Consequences

- The NRA spouse is treated as a **resident alien for the entire year** (and all subsequent years until the election is terminated).
- **Both spouses** are taxed on their **worldwide income** -- the NRA spouse must report all foreign income.
- Both spouses are **jointly and severally liable** for the tax on the joint return.
- The election applies to **all subsequent tax years** until terminated -- it is **not** a year-by-year election.

### Termination of the Election

The election is terminated if:

- Either spouse **revokes** the election.
- Either spouse **dies** (revoked at the beginning of the year following death, unless the surviving spouse is a U.S. citizen who could re-elect).
- The spouses **legally separate** or **divorce**.
- The IRS determines there has been **inadequate record keeping** for either spouse.

### Once Revoked

If the election is revoked or terminated, **neither spouse** may make the election again in any subsequent year. This is a **permanent prohibition** -- it applies even if the individual marries a different U.S. citizen/resident.

### Section 6013(h) -- First Year of Residency

A related election under Section 6013(h) applies to couples in the **first year** one spouse becomes a resident alien. This election treats both spouses as residents for the entire year, allowing a joint return for that first year without the broader ongoing commitment of 6013(g).

## 7. Treaty Benefits

### Overview

The United States has income tax treaties with many countries that may **reduce or eliminate** U.S. tax on certain types of income for residents of those treaty countries.

### Common Treaty Benefits for NRAs

- **Reduced withholding rates** on dividends, interest, and royalties (often 0%, 5%, 10%, or 15% instead of the standard 30%).
- **Exemption for students and trainees** (many treaties exempt scholarship/fellowship income and/or limited amounts of compensation).
- **Exemption for teachers and researchers** (some treaties exempt compensation for teaching or research for a limited period, usually 2--3 years).
- **Business profits exemption** (profits of a foreign enterprise are generally not taxed unless attributable to a U.S. permanent establishment).
- **Tie-breaker rules** for dual-resident individuals.

### Claiming Treaty Benefits

- **Withholding:** Provide **Form W-8BEN** to the withholding agent to claim reduced treaty rates.
- **Tax return:** Report the treaty position and attach **Form 8833** (Treaty-Based Return Position Disclosure) if the treaty reduces or modifies U.S. tax.
- **Disclosure threshold:** Form 8833 is generally not required if payments or income items affected by the treaty do not exceed **$10,000** for the tax year.

### Treaty Override

U.S. tax law can override treaty provisions (under the "later in time" rule). Additionally, some treaty benefits have **limitation on benefits (LOB)** articles that restrict benefits to bona fide residents of the treaty country who meet certain ownership and income tests.

## 8. NRA Taxation: ECI vs. FDAP Income

Nonresident aliens are subject to U.S. tax on **two categories** of U.S.-source income, each taxed under different rules.

### Effectively Connected Income (ECI)

Income that is **effectively connected** with the conduct of a U.S. trade or business.

| Feature | Rule |
|---|---|
| **Examples** | Wages, salaries, self-employment income, business income, certain gains from sale of U.S. real property |
| **Tax rates** | **Graduated rates** (same as U.S. citizens/residents: 10%--37%) |
| **Deductions** | Allowed -- business expenses, personal deductions connected to ECI |
| **Filing** | **Form 1040-NR** |
| **Standard deduction** | Generally **not available** to NRAs (exception: students/business apprentices from India under treaty) |
| **Itemized deductions** | Allowed only if connected and allocable to ECI |

### Fixed, Determinable, Annual, or Periodical Income (FDAP)

Passive-type income from U.S. sources **not** connected to a U.S. trade or business.

| Feature | Rule |
|---|---|
| **Examples** | Dividends, interest (taxable), rents, royalties, annuities, certain gambling winnings, compensation for personal services (if not ECI) |
| **Tax rate** | Flat **30%** on the **gross** amount (no deductions allowed) |
| **Collection** | Generally collected through **withholding at source** |
| **Treaty reduction** | Rate may be reduced (often to 0%, 5%, 10%, or 15%) under an applicable tax treaty |
| **Filing** | May or may not need to file Form 1040-NR (depends on whether tax liability was fully satisfied by withholding) |

### The 30% Withholding Regime

- Withholding agents (payers of FDAP income) must withhold **30%** of the gross payment to NRAs unless a reduced treaty rate applies.
- The NRA provides **Form W-8BEN** to the withholding agent to certify foreign status and claim treaty benefits.
- If excess tax was withheld, the NRA can file **Form 1040-NR** to claim a refund.
- Certain types of income are **exempt** from the 30% withholding: portfolio interest, bank deposit interest, capital gains from sales of personal property (if NRA was in U.S. fewer than 183 days).

### FIRPTA (Foreign Investment in Real Property Tax Act)

- Gains from the sale of **U.S. real property interests** (USRPI) by an NRA are treated as **ECI** and taxed at graduated rates.
- The buyer must generally withhold **15%** of the gross sales price under FIRPTA.

## 9. ITIN Application -- Form W-7

### What Is an ITIN?

An **Individual Taxpayer Identification Number (ITIN)** is a 9-digit number issued by the IRS to individuals who need a U.S. taxpayer identification number but are **not eligible for a Social Security Number (SSN)**.

### Who Needs an ITIN?

- Nonresident aliens required to file a U.S. tax return.
- Nonresident aliens claiming a tax treaty benefit (even if no return is required).
- NRA spouses being claimed as an exemption or making a Section 6013(g) election.
- Dependents of U.S. citizens/residents living abroad who are not eligible for an SSN.

### How to Apply

| Step | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Form** | **Form W-7** (Application for IRS Individual Taxpayer Identification Number) |
| **Submit with** | A completed federal tax return (Form 1040, 1040-NR, etc.) -- unless an exception applies |
| **Documentation** | Original or certified copies of identity/foreign status documents (passport is the only stand-alone document; otherwise, a combination of two or more documents is required) |
| **Where to file** | Mail to IRS ITIN Operation, Austin, TX; or apply in person at an IRS Taxpayer Assistance Center; or through an IRS-authorized Certifying Acceptance Agent (CAA) |
| **Processing time** | **7 weeks** (up to 9--11 weeks during peak filing season, January 15 -- April 30) |

### ITIN Expiration

- ITINs that have **not been used on a federal tax return** for 3 consecutive years **expire** and must be renewed.
- ITINs with middle digits **70--88** (issued before 2013) have been subject to rolling expiration schedules.
- Renewal requires filing a new Form W-7 with supporting documentation.

## 10. Departing Alien -- Sailing Permit (Form 1040-C)

### Requirement

Before departing the United States, most aliens must obtain a **certificate of compliance** (commonly called a **sailing permit** or **departure permit**). This certifies that the alien has complied with U.S. tax obligations.

### How to Obtain

You must file one of the following with the IRS **before departure:**

| Form | When Used |
|---|---|
| **Form 1040-C** (U.S. Departing Alien Income Tax Return) | Alien who owes or may owe U.S. tax for the current or prior year |
| **Form 2063** (U.S. Departing Alien Income Tax Statement) | Alien with no unpaid U.S. tax liability and who qualifies for a simplified procedure |

### Filing Timeline

- File **no earlier than 30 days before** your planned departure.
- File at least **2 weeks before** your departure date.
- File in person at the nearest IRS office, or mail if arrangements are made in advance.

### What Form 1040-C Covers

- All income received (or expected to be received) from **January 1 through the departure date** of the current year.
- All income **reasonably expected** for the remainder of the tax year.
- Tax on the total income is computed, and any tax due must be **paid at the time of filing**.

### Important Notes

- Form 1040-C is **not** a final tax return. You must still file an annual return (**Form 1040-NR** or **Form 1040**) covering the full tax year.
- Tax paid with Form 1040-C is credited against the tax due on the annual return.
- Employers may be required to withhold additional amounts if the departing alien has not obtained a sailing permit.

### Exemptions from the Sailing Permit

The following individuals are **exempt** from obtaining a sailing permit:

- Representatives of foreign governments with A or G visas.
- Students with F-1 or J-1 visas (if no income other than allowances, scholarships, etc.).
- Individuals with H-1B, H-2A, H-2B, or H-3 visas who have no unpaid tax and whose wages are subject to withholding.
- Certain short-term visitors (B-1/B-2) with no U.S. income.
- Individuals with commuter status from Canada or Mexico.

2. You are **not** engaged in a U.S. trade or business but have U.S.-source income on which the tax was **not fully satisfied** by withholding.
3. You want to claim a **refund** of overwithholding or to claim the benefit of deductions or credits.
4. You are filing as a **dual-status alien**.
