## 2025 Instructions for Schedule B (Form 1040) - Interest and Ordinary Dividends

Section references are to the Internal Revenue Code unless otherwise noted.

---

## Purpose of Schedule B

Schedule B (Form 1040) is used to report interest and ordinary dividend income. It consists of three parts:

- **Part I** -- Interest Income
- **Part II** -- Ordinary Dividends
- **Part III** -- Foreign Accounts and Trusts

---

## Who Must File Schedule B

You must complete and attach Schedule B to your Form 1040 or 1040-SR if any of the following apply:

1. You had over **$1,500** of taxable interest or ordinary dividends during the tax year.
2. You had a financial interest in, or signature authority over, a financial account in a foreign country (such as a bank account, securities account, or brokerage account).
3. You received a distribution from, or were a grantor of, or a transferor to, a foreign trust.

### The $1,500 Threshold

The $1,500 threshold is the primary trigger for filing Schedule B. If your combined taxable interest (Part I) or ordinary dividends (Part II) exceed $1,500, you must file Schedule B even if you have no foreign account or trust obligations.

If your taxable interest and ordinary dividends are each $1,500 or less, you generally do not need to file Schedule B -- you simply report the totals directly on Form 1040, lines 2b and 3b. However, you must still file Schedule B if Part III (foreign accounts/trusts) applies to you.

## Part I -- Interest Income (Lines 1-4)

### What to Report

Report on Line 1 all of your taxable interest. List each payer's name and the amount of interest received. Sources of taxable interest include:

- **Bank and credit union interest** -- Reported on Form 1099-INT, Box 1
- **Bond interest** -- Including corporate bonds, Treasury bonds, and municipal bond taxable interest
- **Original Issue Discount (OID)** -- Reported on Form 1099-OID; the OID is treated as interest income
- **Seller-financed mortgage interest** -- If you sold your home or other property and the buyer used the property as a personal residence, list the interest the buyer paid you on the mortgage or other form of seller financing; you must include the buyer's name, address, and SSN, and provide your SSN to the buyer
- **Interest from U.S. savings bonds and Treasury obligations**
- **Interest on tax refunds**
- **Accrued interest on bonds purchased between interest payment dates**

### Nominee Interest

If you received a Form 1099-INT that includes interest you received as a nominee (that is, in your name, but the interest actually belongs to someone else), report the full amount on Line 1 first. Then, below the subtotal of all interest listed on Line 1, enter "Nominee Distribution" and show the total interest you received as a nominee. Subtract this amount from the subtotal and enter the result on Line 4.

You must also file Form 1099-INT for each actual owner to report their share of the interest, unless the other owner is your spouse.

### OID Adjustments

If you are reporting OID in an amount less than the amount shown in Box 1 or Box 8 of Form 1099-OID, follow the nominee rules above to report the adjustment, but identify the amount to be subtracted as "OID Adjustment." However, if the payer reported a net amount of OID on the bond reflecting the offset of gross OID by any acquisition premium, no reduction is permitted on Schedule B for the bond.

### Tax-Exempt Interest

Tax-exempt interest (such as from municipal bonds) is generally shown in Box 8 of Form 1099-INT or, for a tax-exempt OID bond, in Box 2 of Form 1099-OID. Tax-exempt OID is shown in Box 11 of Form 1099-OID. Enter the total on Line 2a of Form 1040 or 1040-SR. This amount is not reported on Schedule B but must still be reported on your return for informational purposes.

### Accrued Interest

If you bought a bond between interest payment dates, part of the purchase price represents accrued interest. When you receive your first interest payment, it will include this accrued interest. You can subtract the accrued interest from your interest income on Schedule B by listing it as a separate line item with the notation "Accrued Interest."

### Line-by-Line Summary

- **Line 1** -- List each payer's name and the amount of taxable interest received
- **Line 2** -- Add the amounts on Line 1
- **Line 3** -- Excludable interest on Series EE and I U.S. savings bonds issued after 1989 (from Form 8815)
- **Line 4** -- Subtract Line 3 from Line 2; enter result here and on Form 1040, line 2b

---

## Part II -- Ordinary Dividends (Lines 5-6)

### What to Report

Report on Line 5 all of your ordinary dividends. List each payer's name and the amount of ordinary dividends received. Sources include:

- **Stock dividends** -- Reported on Form 1099-DIV, Box 1a
- **Mutual fund distributions** -- Ordinary dividend distributions from mutual funds and other regulated investment companies
- **Capital gain distributions** -- Reported on Form 1099-DIV, Box 2a (also reported on Schedule D or directly on Form 1040, line 7)
- **Nondividend distributions** -- Reported on Form 1099-DIV, Box 3 (return of capital; generally not taxable but reduces basis)
- **Foreign tax paid** -- Reported on Form 1099-DIV, Box 7 (you may be able to claim a credit or deduction)
- **Section 199A dividends** -- Qualified REIT dividends reported on Form 1099-DIV, Box 5

### Qualified Dividends

Qualified dividends are reported on Form 1099-DIV, Box 1b, and are entered on Form 1040, line 3a. Qualified dividends are taxed at the lower long-term capital gains rates (0%, 15%, or 20%) rather than ordinary income rates. To qualify, dividends must meet holding period requirements and be paid by a U.S. corporation or qualified foreign corporation.

### Nominee Dividends

If you received dividends as a nominee (in your name but belonging to someone else), report them using the same procedure as nominee interest: include the full amount, then subtract the nominee distribution amount below the subtotal.

### Line-by-Line Summary

- **Line 5** -- List each payer's name and the amount of ordinary dividends received
- **Line 6** -- Add the amounts on Line 5; enter result here and on Form 1040, line 3b

## Part III -- Foreign Accounts and Trusts (Lines 7a-8)

Part III addresses two separate foreign reporting obligations: foreign financial accounts and foreign trusts.

### Line 7a -- Foreign Financial Accounts (Question 1)

**Check "Yes" if** at any time during 2025 you had a financial interest in or signature authority over a financial account located in a foreign country (such as a bank account, securities account, or brokerage account).

#### FBAR Requirement -- FinCEN Form 114

If you checked "Yes" on Line 7a and the aggregate value of all your foreign financial accounts exceeded **$10,000** at any time during the calendar year, you must file FinCEN Form 114, Report of Foreign Bank and Financial Accounts (FBAR).

**Key FBAR details:**
- **Threshold:** $10,000 aggregate value across all foreign accounts at any point during the year
- **Filing deadline:** April 15 (automatic extension to October 15)
- **Where to file:** Electronically through the BSA E-Filing System (not filed with IRS or attached to tax return)
- **Who must file:** U.S. persons (citizens, residents, entities) with financial interest in or signature authority over foreign accounts
- **Account aggregation:** The $10,000 threshold applies to the combined maximum value of ALL foreign accounts; once exceeded, every reportable account must be included
- **Record retention:** Records must be kept for 5 years
- **Penalties for non-filing:**
  - Non-willful violation: Up to $10,000 per violation (adjusted for inflation)
  - Willful violation: The greater of $100,000 or 50% of the account balance at the time of the violation, plus potential criminal penalties

### Line 7b -- FATCA Requirement -- Form 8938

Regardless of whether you are required to file FinCEN Form 114 (FBAR), you may be required to file **Form 8938, Statement of Specified Foreign Financial Assets**, with your income tax return under FATCA (Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act).

#### Form 8938 Filing Thresholds (2025)

**U.S. Residents (living in the United States):**

| Filing Status | End-of-Year Threshold | Any-Time-During-Year Threshold |
|---|---|---|
| Single / Married Filing Separately | $50,000 | $75,000 |
| Married Filing Jointly | $100,000 | $150,000 |

**U.S. Persons Living Abroad:**

| Filing Status | End-of-Year Threshold | Any-Time-During-Year Threshold |
|---|---|---|
| Single / Married Filing Separately | $200,000 | $300,000 |
| Married Filing Jointly | $400,000 | $600,000 |

#### FBAR vs. Form 8938 -- Key Differences

| Feature | FBAR (FinCEN Form 114) | Form 8938 (FATCA) |
|---|---|---|
| Threshold | $10,000 aggregate | Varies by filing status and residency (see above) |
| Filed with | FinCEN (BSA E-Filing) | IRS (attached to tax return) |
| Assets covered | Foreign financial accounts only | Foreign financial accounts plus other specified foreign financial assets (e.g., foreign stock, partnership interests, financial instruments, contracts with foreign entities) |
| Penalties | Up to $10,000 non-willful; greater of $100,000 or 50% of balance for willful | $10,000 for failure to file; additional $10,000 for each 30-day period of non-filing after IRS notice (up to $50,000) |

**Important:** Filing Form 8938 does not relieve you of the requirement to file the FBAR, and vice versa. Both may be required, and separate penalties apply for failure to file each form.

### Line 8 -- Foreign Trusts

**Check "Yes" if** during 2025 you received a distribution from, or were a grantor of, or a transferor to, a foreign trust.

If you check "Yes," you may need to file:
- **Form 3520** -- Annual Return To Report Transactions With Foreign Trusts and Receipt of Certain Foreign Gifts
- **Form 3520-A** -- Annual Information Return of Foreign Trust With a U.S. Owner

### Exceptions to Part III

You are not required to check "Yes" on Line 7a for:
- Accounts in a U.S. military banking facility operated by a U.S. financial institution
- Accounts in which you have a financial interest solely because you are a beneficiary of a trust and the trust has a U.S. agent
