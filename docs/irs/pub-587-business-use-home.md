## 1. Qualifying for the Deduction

To deduct expenses for business use of your home, you must use **part of your home** exclusively and regularly in one of the following ways:

### Exclusive Use Test

You must use a specific area of your home **only** for your trade or business. The area can be a room or other separately identifiable space -- it does not need to be marked off by a permanent partition. You do NOT meet the exclusive use test if you use the area for both business and personal purposes.

### Regular Use Test

You must use a specific area of your home for business on a **continuing basis** -- incidental or occasional use is not sufficient, even if the area is used for no other purpose.

### Qualifying Categories

You must meet the exclusive and regular use tests AND the area must be used as one of the following:

#### A. Principal Place of Business

Your home office qualifies if it is used as the **principal place of business** for any trade or business. To determine this, consider:

1. **Relative importance** of the activities performed at each business location
2. **Time spent** at each location

If you conduct administrative or management activities at your home office, and you have **no other fixed location** where you conduct substantial administrative or management activities, your home office qualifies as your principal place of business -- even if you perform services at other locations (e.g., a plumber who does billing and scheduling at home but performs work at client sites).

#### B. Place to Meet Clients, Patients, or Customers

You can use a portion of your home to **meet or deal with** patients, clients, or customers in the normal course of your trade or business. The meetings must be in person and must take place at your home on a regular basis.

#### C. Separate Structure

A **separate free-standing structure** (studio, workshop, garage, barn) used in connection with your trade or business qualifies if used **exclusively and regularly** for business. It does NOT need to be your principal place of business or a place where you meet clients.

#### D. Storage of Inventory or Product Samples

If you use part of your home for storage of inventory or product samples for your trade or business of **selling products** at retail or wholesale, you can deduct expenses even if the area is NOT used exclusively for business, provided:

- Your home is the **only fixed location** of your trade or business
- The storage space is a **separately identifiable** space suitable for storage
- You use the space on a **regular basis**

#### E. Daycare Exception

If you use space in your home on a **regular basis** to provide daycare for children, persons age 65 or older, or persons who are physically or mentally unable to care for themselves, the **exclusive use test does NOT apply**. However:

- You must be in the **trade or business** of providing daycare
- You must have applied for, been granted, or be exempt from having a **license, certification, registration, or approval** as a daycare center or family/group daycare home under state law

If the space is not used exclusively for daycare, you must reduce the business percentage using a fraction based on hours of actual daycare use divided by total hours available in the year.

### Who Can Claim the Deduction

- **Self-employed individuals** (sole proprietors, independent contractors) -- claim on Schedule C
- **Partners** -- claim on Schedule E (unreimbursed partner expenses)
- **Farmers** -- claim on Schedule F

**W-2 employees CANNOT deduct home office expenses** for tax years 2018-2025 under the TCJA (the employee business expense deduction was suspended).

---

## 2. Figuring the Deduction -- Two Methods

### Simplified Method

The simplified method provides a straightforward calculation:

| Element | Rule |
|---|---|
| Rate | **$5 per square foot** |
| Maximum area | **300 square feet** |
| Maximum deduction | **$1,500** per year |

Additional rules for the simplified method:

- No depreciation deduction or recapture on sale of home
- Allowable home-related **itemized deductions** (mortgage interest, real estate taxes) are claimed in full on Schedule A -- they are NOT reduced by the business-use percentage
- Cannot carry over any unused deduction from a prior year to a year using the simplified method
- Daycare providers using space not exclusively for daycare must reduce the $5 rate proportionally (based on hours of use)
- You can **switch** between the simplified and regular methods from year to year

### Regular Method (Form 8829)

The regular method uses **Form 8829 (Expenses for Business Use of Your Home)** to calculate the actual deduction. It generally produces a larger deduction but requires more recordkeeping.

**Step 1: Calculate the Business-Use Percentage**

Two acceptable approaches:

1. **Square footage method:** Divide the area used for business by the total area of your home
2. **Room method:** If rooms are approximately equal in size, divide the number of rooms used for business by the total number of rooms

**Step 2: Apply Percentage to Allowable Expenses** (see Section 3 below)

**Step 3: Apply the Deduction Limit** (see Section 4 below)

---

## 3. Deducting Expenses

### Types of Expenses

#### Direct Expenses

Expenses that benefit **only** the business part of your home. These are deductible in full (100%) subject to the deduction limit.

Examples:
- Painting or repairs to the specific room used as an office
- A dedicated phone line for business

#### Indirect Expenses

Expenses that benefit the **entire home**. These are deductible only to the extent of the business-use percentage.

Examples:
- Rent
- Mortgage interest
- Real estate taxes
- Utilities (electricity, gas, water, trash, internet)
- Homeowners insurance
- Home security system
- General repairs and maintenance
- Depreciation (for homeowners)

#### Unrelated Expenses

Expenses that benefit **only** the personal portion of your home (e.g., painting a bedroom not used for business, lawn care for areas unrelated to business) are **not deductible** as business expenses.

### Specific Expense Categories

| Expense | Deductible? | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Rent** | Yes (indirect) | Business % of total rent paid |
| **Mortgage interest** | Yes (indirect) | Business % claimed on Form 8829; remainder on Schedule A |
| **Real estate taxes** | Yes (indirect) | Business % claimed on Form 8829; remainder on Schedule A |
| **Utilities** | Yes (indirect) | Business % of electric, gas, water, trash, sewer |
| **Insurance** | Yes (indirect) | Business % of homeowners/renters insurance |
| **Repairs -- office only** | Yes (direct) | 100% deductible |
| **Repairs -- whole home** | Yes (indirect) | Business % deductible |
| **Depreciation** | Yes (indirect) | Business % of depreciation on home (not land); see below |
| **Casualty losses** | Yes (indirect) | Business % if applicable |

### Depreciation (Homeowners Using Regular Method)

If you own your home, you can depreciate the business-use portion. Key rules:

- **Recovery period:** 39 years (nonresidential real property) for the business portion placed in service after May 12, 1993 -- use the **straight-line method** and **mid-month convention**
- **Basis:** Generally your cost or other basis in the home (excluding land), adjusted for improvements and casualties
- You must **subtract the value of the land** from your basis before computing depreciation
- Even if you do not claim the depreciation deduction, it is treated as **"allowed or allowable"** and will affect gain calculations on sale

---

## 4. Deduction Limit

Your home office deduction **cannot exceed the gross income** derived from the business use of your home, minus certain deductions.

### Ordering Rules (Regular Method)

Expenses must be deducted in a specific order, and each tier is limited by the remaining income:

**Tier 1 -- Deductible regardless of business use of home:**
- Business percentage of mortgage interest
- Business percentage of real estate taxes
- Business percentage of casualty losses (if applicable)

*Subtract Tier 1 from gross income to determine remaining limit.*

**Tier 2 -- Expenses attributable to business use (not depreciation):**
- Business percentage of utilities
- Business percentage of insurance
- Business percentage of rent (if renting)
- Business percentage of repairs and maintenance
- Direct expenses (non-depreciation)

*Subtract Tier 2 from remaining income to determine depreciation limit.*

**Tier 3 -- Depreciation:**
- Business percentage of depreciation on the home

If gross income from the business use is insufficient to cover all expenses, expenses in lower tiers cannot be deducted in that year.

### Gross Income for the Limit

The gross income figure is the **gross income from the business** in which you use your home, minus:

- Business expenses NOT related to the use of your home (e.g., advertising, supplies, wages)
- The portion of Schedule A deductions (mortgage interest, real estate taxes) allocable to the business use

---

## 5. Carryforward of Disallowed Expenses

If your deduction is limited by the gross income rule:

- **Regular method:** Unused expenses can be **carried forward** to the next tax year, subject to the same gross income limitation in that year. The carryforward applies tier by tier (operating expenses before depreciation).
- **Simplified method:** There is **NO carryforward**. Amounts exceeding the $1,500 limit (or the gross income limit) are simply lost.
- If you switch from the regular method to the simplified method, you **cannot carry forward** unused expenses from the regular-method year into a simplified-method year. However, those amounts may be available if you switch back to the regular method in a future year.

---

## 6. Sale of Home With Business Use

### Business Use Within the Home

If the business-use area is **within your home** (e.g., a room used as a home office, rooms used for daycare), you do **NOT** need to:

- Allocate gain between the business and personal portions
- Report the sale of the business portion on Form 4797

You may claim the full **Section 121 exclusion** ($250,000 single / $500,000 married filing jointly) on the entire gain, provided you meet the ownership and use tests.

### Depreciation Recapture

**However**, you **cannot exclude** the portion of gain equal to **depreciation allowed or allowable** after May 6, 1997. This depreciation recapture is taxed as **unrecaptured Section 1250 gain** at a maximum rate of **25%**, and must be reported on Form 4797 and Schedule D.

This applies even if you used the simplified method in some years (since no depreciation is claimed under the simplified method, only years using the regular method create recapture exposure).

### Separate Structure or Separate Dwelling Unit

If the business portion of your property is a **separate structure** or a portion of your home that was used as a **separate dwelling unit** (e.g., a converted apartment), you **must**:

- Allocate the gain between the business portion and the residential portion
- Report the business portion on **Form 4797** (Sales of Business Property)
- The Section 121 exclusion applies only to the residential portion

---

## 7. Form 8829 Overview

**Form 8829 -- Expenses for Business Use of Your Home** is used by sole proprietors (Schedule C filers) to compute the home office deduction under the regular method.

### Part I -- Part of Your Home Used for Business

- Calculate the business-use percentage (square footage or room count method)
- For daycare providers, calculate the time-use percentage and multiply by the area percentage

### Part II -- Figure Your Allowable Deduction

- Line 8: Gross income from the business
- Lines 9-20: Enter direct and indirect expenses (Tier 1 items first, then operating expenses, then depreciation)
- Line 25: Casualty losses and depreciation
- Lines 26-36: Apply the deduction limit, compute allowable deduction
- The form enforces the ordering rules (Tiers 1, 2, and 3)

### Part III -- Depreciation of Your Home

- Enter the adjusted basis or fair market value (whichever is less) of your home (excluding land)
- Calculate the depreciation percentage based on the month placed in service
- The depreciation percentage for a full year under the 39-year straight-line method is approximately **2.564%** (or a prorated amount for the first and last year using the mid-month convention)

### Part IV -- Carryover of Unallowed Expenses to Next Year

- Operating expenses and depreciation that exceeded the income limit are entered here
- These amounts carry to next year's Form 8829

### Filing Notes

| Situation | Where to Report |
|---|---|
| Sole proprietor (regular method) | Form 8829, result flows to Schedule C, Line 30 |
| Sole proprietor (simplified method) | Schedule C, Line 30 (no Form 8829 needed) |
| Partner | Worksheet in Pub. 587, result flows to Schedule E |
| Farmer | Worksheet in Pub. 587, result flows to Schedule F |

## 8. Special Situations

### More Than One Business

If you use your home in more than one business, you must apply the rules separately for each business. You can use the simplified method for one business and the regular method for another, but the combined area cannot exceed the total area actually used for business, and the simplified method is still capped at 300 square feet total.

### Part-Year Use

If you start or stop using your home for business during the year, you must prorate expenses for the number of months the space was used for business. Under the simplified method, you prorate the allowable square footage by the number of months of qualified use.

### Renters

Renters can deduct the business-use percentage of rent paid. Since there is no depreciation for renters, the depreciation tier is inapplicable. Renters do NOT file Form 8829 for the depreciation section -- only the expense allocation portions apply.

### Day Care Facilities

Daycare providers who do not use the space exclusively for daycare must calculate a reduced business percentage:

```
Business % = (Area used for daycare / Total home area) x (Hours used for daycare / Total hours in year)
```

Total hours in a year = 8,760 (365 days x 24 hours). For a leap year, use 8,784.
