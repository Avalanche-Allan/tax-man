## Overview

Form 8829, "Expenses for Business Use of Your Home," is used to calculate the
allowable deduction for business use of your home. The resulting deduction is reported
on **Schedule C (Form 1040), Line 30**. Any expenses that exceed the current-year
deduction limit are carried over to future tax years.

Form 8829 is filed **only** with Schedule C. It is organized into four parts:

- **Part I** -- Calculates the business-use percentage of the home
- **Part II** -- Figures the allowable deduction (subject to gross income limits)
- **Part III** -- Computes depreciation of the home
- **Part IV** -- Tracks carryover of unallowed expenses to the next year

---

## Who Qualifies

### General Requirement: Exclusive and Regular Use

To deduct expenses for business use of your home, the portion of your home used for
business must be used **exclusively** and on a **regular basis** for one of the
following:

1. **Principal place of business** -- The home office is the principal place of
   business for any trade or business you conduct. Under the simplified "administrative
   or management" test, a home office qualifies as the principal place of business if:
   - You use it regularly and exclusively for administrative or management activities of
     your trade or business, **and**
   - There is no other fixed location where you conduct substantial administrative or
     management activities of that trade or business.

2. **Place to meet clients/customers** -- You use the space to meet or deal with
   patients, clients, or customers in the normal course of your trade or business.
   The patients, clients, or customers must physically come to your home.

3. **Separate structure** -- The space is a separate structure not attached to your
   home (e.g., a detached garage, studio, or barn) used in connection with your trade
   or business. The separate structure does not need to be your principal place of
   business; it just needs a business connection.

### Exceptions to the Exclusive-Use Test

The exclusive-use requirement does **not** apply in two situations:

- **Daycare facility** -- If you use part of your home on a regular basis to provide
  daycare for children, persons age 65 or older, or persons who are physically or
  mentally unable to care for themselves. You must be licensed, certified, registered,
  or approved as a daycare provider under state law (unless exempt from licensing).

- **Storage of inventory or product samples** -- If you use part of your home for
  storing inventory or product samples for your trade or business of selling products
  at retail or wholesale, provided your home is the sole fixed location of that
  business.

### Who Cannot Use Form 8829

Do **not** use Form 8829 if:

- You are claiming actual expenses for business use of your home **as a partner** (use
  the partnership agreement and your own records instead)
- You are claiming these expenses on **Schedule F** (Form 1040) for farm business
- You have elected to use the **simplified method** for this home for 2025

---

## Simplified Method (Alternative to Form 8829)

Instead of computing actual expenses on Form 8829, you may elect the simplified method:

| Item | Rule |
|------|------|
| Rate | **$5 per square foot** of the home used for business |
| Maximum area | **300 square feet** |
| Maximum deduction | **$1,500** per year ($5 x 300 sq ft) |
| Depreciation | None claimed; no depreciation recapture on sale of home |
| Carryover | No carryover of unused deduction allowed |
| Itemized deductions | Full amount of mortgage interest, property taxes, and casualty losses still claimed on Schedule A (not reduced by business-use percentage) |
| Multiple businesses | The 300 sq ft limit is shared among all qualifying business uses of the home |

### Method Selection

- You choose a method by using it on your **timely filed, original** federal income tax
  return for the year.
- You **cannot** change methods for the same tax year after filing.
- You **may** switch between methods from year to year (e.g., actual method one year,
  simplified the next).
- If you switch from the actual method to the simplified method, any unallowed expenses
  from the prior year carried forward under the actual method **cannot** be deducted in
  the simplified-method year but are carried forward to the next year you use the actual
  method.

## Part I -- Part of Your Home Used for Business

Part I determines the business-use percentage, which is applied to indirect expenses
throughout the rest of the form.

### Line-by-Line

| Line | Description | Notes |
|------|-------------|-------|
| **1** | Area used regularly and exclusively for business, regularly for daycare, or for storage of inventory | Enter in square feet. For daycare, enter the total area used (exclusive use not required). |
| **2** | Total area of home | Enter in square feet. |
| **3** | Divide line 1 by line 2 | This is the **business-use percentage**. Express as a decimal (e.g., 0.20 for 20%). |
| **4** | Multiply days used for daycare during year by hours used per day | Only for daycare providers who do **not** use the space exclusively for daycare. |
| **5** | Total hours available for use during the year (8,760 for a full year) | 365 days x 24 hours = 8,760. |
| **6** | Divide line 4 by line 5 | Time-use percentage for daycare facility. |
| **7** | Business percentage | For daycare: multiply line 3 by line 6. For all others: enter amount from line 3. This is the percentage used throughout Part II. |

### Calculating Business Percentage -- Two Methods

You may use either method to determine the area on lines 1 and 2:

1. **Square footage method** (preferred and more accurate) -- Measure the actual
   square footage of the rooms or areas used for business and divide by the total
   square footage of the home.

2. **Number of rooms method** -- If the rooms in your home are approximately the same
   size, you may divide the number of rooms used for business by the total number of
   rooms. For example, if you use 1 room of an 8-room house, the business percentage
   is 12.5%.

## Part II -- Figure Your Allowable Deduction

Part II calculates the deductible amount, applying a **deduction ordering system** that
limits total home office deductions to the gross income derived from the business use of
the home. Expenses are deducted in three tiers, each limited by remaining gross income.

### Direct vs. Indirect Expenses

| Type | Definition | Examples | Column |
|------|-----------|----------|--------|
| **Direct** | Benefit only the business part of your home | Painting the office, repairs to office only, dedicated phone line for the office | Column (a) -- enter full amount |
| **Indirect** | Benefit the entire home; allocated by business percentage | Mortgage interest, property taxes, insurance, utilities, general repairs, depreciation | Column (b) -- multiplied by line 7 percentage |

### Line-by-Line

**Gross Income Limit**

| Line | Description | Notes |
|------|-------------|-------|
| **8** | Gross income from the business use of your home | Enter tentative profit from the business use of home. If all gross income is from home use, this is generally **Schedule C, line 29** (gross profit minus all non-home business expenses). If only part of the income is from the home office, prorate accordingly. This amount is the ceiling for total home office deductions. |

**Tier 1 -- Expenses Deductible Regardless of Business Income**
(These would be deductible even without business use, e.g., as itemized deductions.)

| Line | Description | Notes |
|------|-------------|-------|
| **9** | Casualty losses (see Form 4684 and instructions) | Column (a): direct. Column (b): indirect (multiplied by line 7 on line 13). |
| **10** | Deductible mortgage interest (see instructions) | Column (a): direct. Column (b): indirect. Includes home mortgage interest that would be deductible on Schedule A. |
| **11** | Real estate taxes (see instructions) | Column (a): direct. Column (b): indirect. Includes real estate taxes that would be deductible on Schedule A (subject to the $10,000 SALT cap). |
| **12** | Add lines 9, 10, and 11 | Subtotal for each column. |
| **13** | Multiply line 12, column (b) by line 7 | Applies business percentage to indirect Tier 1 expenses. |
| **14** | Add line 12, column (a) and line 13 | **Total Tier 1 deduction.** This amount is always deductible and reduces the available income limit for Tier 2 and 3 expenses. |
| **15** | Subtract line 14 from line 8. If zero or less, enter -0- | **Remaining income available** for Tier 2 and Tier 3 expenses. |

**Tier 2 -- Operating Expenses**
(Deductible only to the extent of remaining income after Tier 1.)

| Line | Description | Notes |
|------|-------------|-------|
| **16** | Excess mortgage interest (not deductible on Schedule A) | Column (a): direct. Column (b): indirect. Mortgage interest that exceeds Schedule A limits. |
| **17** | Insurance | Column (a): direct. Column (b): indirect. Homeowner's or renter's insurance premiums. |
| **18** | Rent | Column (a): direct. Column (b): indirect. If you rent your home, the rent paid. You cannot deduct rent and depreciation for the same space. |
| **19** | Repairs and maintenance | Column (a): direct. Column (b): indirect. General repairs and maintenance to the home (indirect) or to the office space only (direct). |
| **20** | Utilities | Column (a): direct. Column (b): indirect. Electric, gas, water, sewer, trash removal, etc. A dedicated business phone line is a direct expense. |
| **21** | Other expenses (see instructions) | Column (a): direct. Column (b): indirect. Security system monitoring, pest control, etc. |
| **22** | Add lines 16 through 21 | Subtotal for each column. |
| **23** | Multiply line 22, column (b) by line 7 | Applies business percentage to indirect Tier 2 expenses. |
| **24** | Carryover of prior year operating expenses (from last year's Form 8829, line 43) | Enter amount from Part IV of the prior year's Form 8829. |
| **25** | Add line 22, column (a), line 23, and line 24 | Total Tier 2 operating expenses. |
| **26** | Allowable operating expenses | Enter the **smaller of line 15 or line 25**. If line 15 is zero, no operating expenses are deductible this year (carry forward the excess). |

**Tier 3 -- Depreciation and Excess Casualty Losses**
(Deductible only to the extent of remaining income after Tiers 1 and 2.)

| Line | Description | Notes |
|------|-------------|-------|
| **27** | Limit on excess casualty losses and depreciation | Subtract line 26 from line 15. This is the remaining income available for Tier 3 expenses. |
| **28** | Excess casualty losses (see instructions) | Casualty losses in excess of the amounts already deducted in Tier 1. |
| **29** | Depreciation of your home from line 42 (Part III) | See Part III calculation below. |
| **30** | Carryover of prior year excess casualty losses and depreciation (from last year's Form 8829, line 44) | Enter amount from Part IV of the prior year's Form 8829. |
| **31** | Add lines 28 through 30 | Total Tier 3 expenses. |
| **32** | Allowable excess casualty losses and depreciation | Enter the **smaller of line 27 or line 31**. |

**Final Calculation**

| Line | Description | Notes |
|------|-------------|-------|
| **33** | Add lines 14, 26, and 32 | Total expenses for business use of home before casualty loss carryover. |
| **34** | Casualty loss portion, if any, from lines 14 and 32 | Allocated amount of casualty losses. Carry to Form 4684, Section B. |
| **35** | Allowable expenses for business use of your home | Subtract line 34 from line 33. **Enter here and on Schedule C, Line 30.** |

### Deduction Ordering Rules Summary

The three-tier ordering system ensures expenses are deducted in this priority:

```
Tier 1:  Mortgage interest + real estate taxes + casualty losses
         (deductible even without business use)
         Always deductible up to gross income from business use.

Tier 2:  Operating expenses (insurance, rent, utilities, repairs, other)
         Deductible only from remaining income after Tier 1.

Tier 3:  Depreciation + excess casualty losses
         Deductible only from remaining income after Tiers 1 and 2.
```

Expenses that cannot be deducted in the current year due to the gross income limitation
are **carried forward** to the next tax year (tracked in Part IV). When carried forward,
they retain their tier classification.

---

## Part III -- Depreciation of Your Home

Part III calculates the depreciation deduction for the business-use portion of your
home. If you rent your home, skip Part III (you deduct rent in Part II instead).

### Line-by-Line

| Line | Description | Notes |
|------|-------------|-------|
| **36** | Enter the **smaller of** your home's adjusted basis or its fair market value on the date you first used it for business | Adjusted basis is generally original cost plus improvements minus any prior depreciation or casualty loss deductions. If you converted a personal residence to business use, use the smaller of adjusted basis or FMV at conversion date. |
| **37** | Value of land included on line 36 | Land is not depreciable. Allocate between land and building using property tax assessments, appraisals, or other reasonable methods. |
| **38** | Basis of building | Subtract line 37 from line 36. |
| **39** | Business basis of building | Multiply line 38 by **line 7** (business percentage). |
| **40** | Depreciation percentage | For residential property placed in service **before this year**: enter **2.564%** (straight-line, 39-year life for home offices; this reflects the mid-month convention -- the actual percentage for a full year is 1/39 = 2.564%). For property placed in service **this year**: use the IRS percentage table based on the month placed in service (Table will be in the Form 8829 instructions). |
| **41** | Depreciation allowable | Multiply line 39 by line 40. |
| **42** | **Enter line 41 here and on line 29 above** | This is the depreciation amount that flows back to Part II, Tier 3. |

### Key Depreciation Rules

- Residential property used for business is depreciated over **39 years** using the
  **straight-line method** and the **mid-month convention**.
- The depreciation percentage for a full year (property in service all year) is
  **2.564%** (i.e., 100% / 39 years).
- For the first year, the percentage depends on the month placed in service (ranges
  from 2.461% for January to 0.107% for December).
- Depreciation reduces your basis in the home. When you sell the home, any depreciation
  claimed (or allowed) after May 6, 1997, is subject to **Section 1250 unrecaptured
  gain** taxed at a maximum rate of **25%**.

---

## Part IV -- Carryover of Unallowed Expenses to Next Year

Part IV tracks expenses that could not be deducted in the current year because they
exceeded the gross income limitation. These amounts carry forward to the next year you
use the actual method for Form 8829.

### Line-by-Line

| Line | Description | Notes |
|------|-------------|-------|
| **43** | Operating expenses carryover | Subtract line 26 from line 25. If line 25 is less than or equal to line 26, enter -0-. This is the **Tier 2 carryover** to next year's Form 8829, line 24. |
| **44** | Excess casualty losses and depreciation carryover | Subtract line 32 from line 31. If line 31 is less than or equal to line 32, enter -0-. This is the **Tier 3 carryover** to next year's Form 8829, line 30. |

### Carryover Rules

- Carryover amounts retain their character (operating expenses remain operating
  expenses; depreciation remains depreciation).
- If you switch to the **simplified method** in a future year, the carryover amounts
  are **suspended** (not lost) -- they carry forward to the next year you use the
  actual (Form 8829) method.
- There is **no time limit** on how long expenses can be carried forward.
- If you **stop using your home for business**, any remaining carryover amounts are
  **lost** and cannot be deducted.

## Actual Method vs. Simplified Method Comparison

| Factor | Actual Method (Form 8829) | Simplified Method |
|--------|--------------------------|-------------------|
| Calculation | Detailed computation of actual expenses | $5 per sq ft of business area |
| Maximum deduction | Limited by gross income from business | $1,500 (300 sq ft x $5) |
| Depreciation | Yes, claimed and tracked | No depreciation claimed |
| Depreciation recapture on sale | Yes, Section 1250 recapture at 25% | No recapture (none claimed) |
| Carryover of excess expenses | Yes, to future years | No carryover allowed |
| Effect on Schedule A | Mortgage interest and taxes reduced by business-use portion | Full mortgage interest and taxes on Schedule A |
| Record-keeping | Detailed records of all home expenses required | Minimal -- just square footage |
| Best for | Taxpayers with high home expenses relative to business income | Taxpayers with small offices or who want simplicity |

---

## Flow to Schedule C

```
Form 8829, Line 35  -->  Schedule C, Line 30  (expenses for business use of home)
```

The deduction reduces net profit on Schedule C, which in turn reduces both income tax
and self-employment tax.
