## Overview

**Form 7206** is used to calculate the **self-employed health insurance deduction**, which allows eligible self-employed individuals to deduct premiums paid for health insurance for themselves, their spouse, their dependents, and their children under age 27 at the end of the tax year. This is an **above-the-line deduction** (adjustment to income), meaning it reduces adjusted gross income (AGI) regardless of whether the taxpayer itemizes deductions.

The form was introduced starting with tax year 2023 to formalize the computation that was previously done on worksheets in the Schedule 1 instructions.

---

## Who Can Claim the Deduction

### Self-Employed Individuals

You may be able to claim the deduction if you were self-employed and had a **net profit** for the year from a trade or business reported on:

- **Schedule C** (Form 1040) -- Sole proprietorship
- **Schedule F** (Form 1040) -- Farming
- **Schedule K-1** (Form 1065) -- Partnership (as a partner)

The insurance plan must be **established under your business** (i.e., the business must have established the plan, or you must have established the plan in your own name as a self-employed individual).

### More-Than-2% S Corporation Shareholders

If you are a **more-than-2% shareholder** in an S corporation:

- The S corporation pays for or reimburses your health insurance premiums
- The premiums are included in your **W-2 wages** (Box 1) from the S corporation
- You are then eligible to deduct those premiums on Form 7206 as a self-employed health insurance deduction
- The premiums included in your W-2 are **not** subject to Social Security or Medicare taxes (they are in Box 1 but not in Boxes 3 or 5)

### Partners in Partnerships

If you are a **partner** and the partnership pays health insurance premiums on your behalf:

- The premiums are reported as **guaranteed payments** on Schedule K-1 (Form 1065), Box 4
- Or the premiums may be reported in Box 13 with Code M
- You can deduct the premiums on Form 7206 using the guaranteed payment or distribution amount

### Who CANNOT Claim the Deduction

- Employees (W-2 earners) who are not more-than-2% S corp shareholders
- Self-employed individuals with a **net loss** from the applicable business (the deduction cannot exceed net SE income from the specific business under which the plan is established)
- Individuals who were **eligible to participate** in an employer-sponsored health plan (including a spouse's plan) -- see the employer plan rule below

---

## Eligible Insurance Premiums

### Types of Insurance That Qualify

- **Medical insurance** -- premiums for health insurance covering medical care
- **Dental insurance** -- premiums for standalone dental coverage
- **Vision insurance** -- premiums for standalone vision coverage
- **Long-term care insurance** -- qualified long-term care insurance premiums (subject to age-based limits)

### Who Can Be Covered

Premiums paid for coverage of the following individuals qualify:

- **You** (the self-employed individual)
- **Your spouse**
- **Your dependents** (as defined for tax purposes)
- **Your children under age 27** at the end of the tax year (the child does not need to be your dependent)

### What Does NOT Qualify

- Premiums for **disability insurance** or **income replacement** policies
- Premiums for **workers' compensation** insurance
- Amounts paid for coverage during months you were eligible for an employer-sponsored plan
- Premiums for **COBRA coverage** can qualify if you are otherwise eligible (you must be self-employed and not eligible for other employer coverage during those months)

---

## Long-Term Care Insurance Age-Based Limits

For qualified long-term care insurance, the deductible premium is limited to the following amounts per person for 2025:

| Age at End of Tax Year | Maximum Deductible Premium (2025) |
|------------------------|----------------------------------|
| **40 or younger** | **$480** |
| **41 to 50** | **$900** |
| **51 to 60** | **$1,800** |
| **61 to 70** | **$4,810** |
| **71 or older** | **$6,020** |

### How the Limit Applies

- The limit is **per person** covered (you, your spouse, each dependent)
- If actual premiums paid exceed the age-based limit, only the limit amount is included in the deduction calculation
- These limits apply to the total of premiums entered on all Forms 7206 for the same person (if you have multiple businesses/plans)
- The age-based limits are **indexed annually** for inflation

---

## Medicare Premiums

Self-employed individuals who are enrolled in Medicare may deduct the following premiums under the self-employed health insurance deduction:

### Deductible Medicare Premiums

- **Medicare Part A** premiums (if you voluntarily enrolled and pay premiums -- most people get Part A premium-free)
- **Medicare Part B** premiums (medical insurance)
- **Medicare Part D** premiums (prescription drug coverage)
- **Medicare Advantage (Part C)** premiums
- **Medigap (Medicare Supplement)** premiums

### Requirements

- The same eligibility rules apply: you must be self-employed with net profit, the coverage must be established under your business, and you cannot be eligible for employer-sponsored coverage
- Medicare premiums can be deducted even if they are deducted from your Social Security benefits (you are considered to have "paid" the premiums)

---

## Months of Eligibility -- The Employer Plan Rule

You **cannot** claim the self-employed health insurance deduction for any month in which you were **eligible to participate** in a subsidized health plan maintained by:

- **Your employer** (if you have a W-2 job in addition to self-employment)
- **Your spouse's employer**
- **The employer of your dependent** or **child under age 27**

### Key Points

- "Eligible to participate" means you **could have** enrolled in the plan, even if you chose not to
- Eligibility for even **one day** of a month disqualifies the entire month
- This rule applies on a **month-by-month** basis -- you may be able to deduct premiums for months when you were NOT eligible for employer coverage
- **COBRA continuation coverage** from a prior employer does NOT count as being eligible for employer-sponsored coverage (COBRA is generally not subsidized)

### Example

If you left your W-2 job on March 15 and were eligible for the employer plan through March 31, you cannot deduct self-employed health insurance premiums for January, February, or March. You can deduct premiums for April through December (assuming you meet all other requirements).

## The Limitation Formula

The self-employed health insurance deduction **cannot exceed** the net earnings from the specific business under which the insurance plan is established. The formula on Form 7206 works as follows:

### For Sole Proprietors (Schedule C / Schedule F)

```
Line 4:  Net profit from the business (Schedule C line 31, or Schedule F line 34)
Line 5:  Deductible part of self-employment tax attributable to this business
         (from Schedule SE)
Line 6:  Deductions for contributions to qualified retirement plans
         (SEP, SIMPLE, qualified plans) attributable to this business
Line 7:  Line 4 minus Line 5 minus Line 6 = Earned income limit
```

The deduction on Line 14 is the **smaller of**:
- The total eligible premiums paid (Line 13), OR
- The earned income limit (Line 7)

### For S Corporation Shareholders (>2%)

```
Line 11: Net income from the S corporation (W-2 wages as a >2% shareholder
         that include health insurance premiums)
Line 12: Deductions for contributions to qualified retirement plans
         attributable to the S corporation income
Line 13: Line 11 minus Line 12 = Earned income limit
```

### For Partners

```
Line 4:  Net profit from partnership (guaranteed payments plus
         distributive share of net income related to the plan)
Line 5:  Deductible part of self-employment tax attributable to partnership
Line 6:  Deductions for retirement plan contributions attributable to partnership
Line 7:  Line 4 minus Line 5 minus Line 6 = Earned income limit
```

### Critical Rule

If the earned income limit from the applicable business is **zero or negative**, no self-employed health insurance deduction is allowed from that business for the year. Excess premiums cannot be carried forward.

---

## Multiple Businesses and Plans

If you have **more than one** health insurance plan established under **different businesses**, you must complete a **separate Form 7206** for each business/plan combination.

### How It Works

- Each Form 7206 computes the earned income limit using the net profit from **that specific business**
- Premiums for a plan established under Business A can only be deducted against Business A's income
- You cannot use net profit from Business B to increase the deduction for Business A's plan
- The total self-employed health insurance deduction reported on Schedule 1, Line 17 is the **sum** of all Forms 7206

---

## Interaction with Premium Tax Credit (Iterative Calculation)

If you obtained health insurance through the **Health Insurance Marketplace** and you receive or are claiming the **Premium Tax Credit (PTC)** or had **Advance Premium Tax Credit (APTC)** paid on your behalf, the self-employed health insurance deduction and the PTC interact in a **circular manner** that requires an iterative calculation.

### Why the Calculation Is Circular

1. The **self-employed health insurance deduction** reduces your AGI
2. Lower AGI changes your **household income as a percentage of FPL**
3. This changes your **expected contribution** toward the benchmark plan
4. Which changes your **Premium Tax Credit** amount
5. A higher PTC reduces the **net premium you pay** (premiums minus PTC)
6. The self-employed health insurance deduction is limited to the **net premium** (premiums minus PTC)
7. A lower deduction increases your AGI... and the cycle repeats

### How to Resolve the Circular Calculation

The IRS provides guidance in **Publication 974** (Premium Tax Credit) for performing the iterative calculation. The general approach:

1. **Start** with a preliminary self-employed health insurance deduction (using the full premium amount)
2. **Calculate** your preliminary AGI and household income
3. **Compute** the PTC based on that household income
4. **Recalculate** the self-employed health insurance deduction using the net premium (gross premium minus PTC)
5. **Repeat** steps 2-4 until the amounts stabilize (typically 3-5 iterations)
6. The final stable amounts become your actual deduction and PTC

### When the Iterative Calculation Applies

- You purchased health insurance through a Marketplace (exchange)
- The plan is established under your self-employment business
- You received APTC or are claiming PTC on Form 8962
- You are also claiming the self-employed health insurance deduction on Form 7206

### When the Iterative Calculation Does NOT Apply

- Your health insurance is NOT from the Marketplace (e.g., private individual policy, employer group plan for >2% S corp shareholders)
- You received no APTC and are claiming no PTC
- The business under which the plan is established has no net profit (so no deduction is available anyway)

## Where the Deduction Flows on the Return

The self-employed health insurance deduction is reported as follows:

- **Form 7206, Line 14** (or the total from multiple Forms 7206) flows to
- **Schedule 1 (Form 1040), Line 17** ("Self-employed health insurance deduction")
- Schedule 1 flows to **Form 1040, Line 10** (Adjustments to income)
- This reduces **Adjusted Gross Income (AGI)**

This is an **above-the-line deduction** (adjustment to income), which means:
- It benefits taxpayers whether they itemize or take the standard deduction
- It reduces AGI, which can affect eligibility for other deductions and credits that phase out based on AGI
- It is reported on Schedule 1, NOT on Schedule C, Schedule F, or any business schedule

---

## NOT a Business Expense on Schedule C

**The self-employed health insurance deduction is NOT a business expense.** This is a critical distinction.

### What This Means

- Do **not** deduct health insurance premiums on **Schedule C** (line 15 or any other line)
- Do **not** deduct health insurance premiums on **Schedule F**
- Do **not** reduce self-employment income by the health insurance deduction
- The deduction is a **personal** adjustment to income, not a business deduction
- If you mistakenly deduct it on Schedule C, you will both understate your self-employment income (reducing SE tax) and overstate your business deductions

### Why It Matters

Schedule C net profit feeds into:
- Schedule SE for self-employment tax
- The earned income limit on Form 7206

If you incorrectly deduct premiums on Schedule C, it would reduce the net profit used in both calculations, creating incorrect results.

---

## Effect on Self-Employment Tax

The self-employed health insurance deduction **does not reduce** net earnings from self-employment.

- You **cannot** subtract the self-employed health insurance deduction when figuring net earnings for self-employment tax on Schedule SE
- Self-employment tax is computed on Schedule SE using the net profit from Schedule C (or Schedule F, or partnership income) before any self-employed health insurance deduction
- The only deductions that reduce self-employment income for SE tax purposes are the deductible half of SE tax itself and certain other specific items -- the health insurance deduction is not one of them

---

## Effect on Itemized Deductions (Schedule A)

If you claim the self-employed health insurance deduction on Schedule 1, Line 17:

- Do **not** include those same premiums as a medical expense on **Schedule A** (itemized deductions)
- You cannot "double dip" -- the same premium dollars cannot be both an above-the-line deduction and an itemized medical expense
- If your total medical/dental premiums exceed the self-employed health insurance deduction (e.g., because the deduction was limited by net profit), you **may** include the excess on Schedule A, subject to the 7.5% of AGI floor

---

### When to Use Publication 974

If you checked the box indicating your insurance was obtained through the Health Insurance Marketplace and you are reconciling PTC on Form 8962, use Publication 974 for the iterative calculation worksheets instead of the standard Form 7206 computation.
