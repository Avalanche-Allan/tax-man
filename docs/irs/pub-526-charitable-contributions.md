## 1. Overview

Publication 526 explains how to claim a deduction for charitable contributions on
Schedule A (Form 1040). It covers qualified organizations, types of deductible
contributions, AGI-based percentage limits, carryover rules, substantiation and
recordkeeping requirements, and non-deductible contributions.

Charitable contributions are an **itemized deduction** on Schedule A, line 12. Taxpayers
who claim the standard deduction generally cannot deduct charitable contributions for
tax year 2025. (Note: Beginning with tax year 2026, a limited above-the-line deduction
of up to $1,000 / $2,000 MFJ for cash contributions may be available under the
One Big Beautiful Bill Act.)

## 3. AGI Percentage Limits

The total charitable contribution deduction is limited to a percentage of AGI. The
applicable limit depends on the type of contribution and the type of recipient organization.

### Summary of AGI Limits

| Contribution Type | Organization Type | AGI Limit |
|-------------------|------------------|-----------|
| Cash | 50% limit organizations (most public charities, churches, educational institutions, hospitals, government entities) | **60%** |
| Cash | 30% limit organizations (veterans' organizations, fraternal societies, nonprofit cemeteries, certain private foundations) | **30%** |
| Capital gain property (FMV) | 50% limit organizations | **30%** |
| Capital gain property (FMV) | 30% limit organizations | **20%** |
| Capital gain property (elected reduced basis) | 50% limit organizations | **50%** |
| Ordinary income property (basis) | 50% limit organizations | **50%** |

### 60% Limit -- Cash to Public Charities

Cash contributions to 50% limit organizations (most public charities, churches,
educational institutions, hospitals, and government entities) are deductible up to
**60% of AGI**.

### 30% Limit -- Capital Gain Property or Cash to Certain Organizations

- **Capital gain property** (long-term appreciated property) donated to 50% limit
  organizations at fair market value: limited to **30% of AGI**.
- **Cash** contributions to 30% limit organizations (veterans' organizations, fraternal
  societies, nonprofit cemeteries, certain private foundations): limited to **30% of AGI**.

### 20% Limit -- Capital Gain Property to Certain Organizations

Capital gain property donated to 30% limit organizations at fair market value is limited
to **20% of AGI**.

### 50% Limit -- Reduced Basis Election

If you elect to reduce the value of capital gain property to its adjusted basis (rather
than FMV), the contribution is subject to the **50% limit** instead of the 30% limit.
This election applies to all capital gain property contributed during the year.

### Ordering Rules

When multiple limits apply, contributions subject to lower percentage limits are applied
after contributions subject to higher percentage limits. The overall charitable deduction
cannot exceed **60% of AGI** for the year (or 50% for certain combinations).

### Example

| Item | Amount |
|------|--------|
| AGI | $200,000 |
| Cash to public charity | $130,000 |
| 60% limit ($200,000 x 0.60) | $120,000 |
| Deductible this year | $120,000 |
| Carryforward to next year | $10,000 |

---

## 4. Carryover of Excess Contributions (5 Years)

Contributions that exceed the AGI percentage limits in the current year can be
**carried forward for up to 5 years**.

### Rules

- Carryover amounts retain their original character (cash vs. property, 60%/50%/30%/20% limit type).
- Current-year contributions are deducted first; carryover amounts are used only after current-year contributions are applied.
- Carryover amounts are subject to the same AGI percentage limits in the carryforward year.
- If not used within the 5-year carryover period, the excess is permanently lost.
- If the taxpayer dies before using the carryover, the unused portion is lost (no transfer to spouse or estate).

### Tracking Carryovers

Maintain records showing:
- The year of the original contribution
- The type of contribution and applicable AGI limit
- The amount carried forward each year
- The amount used in each subsequent year

---

## 5. Substantiation Requirements

### Cash Contributions -- All Amounts

For **every** cash contribution (regardless of amount), you must maintain:

- A bank record (canceled check, bank statement, credit card statement), **or**
- A written receipt or communication from the donee organization showing the organization's name, date, and amount.

> **Note:** A cash contribution without a bank record or written receipt is not deductible, even if less than $250.

### Cash and Non-Cash Contributions of $250 or More

For any single contribution of **$250 or more** (cash or property), you must obtain a **contemporaneous written acknowledgment (CWA)** from the donee organization containing:

1. The amount of cash contributed (or description of non-cash property).
2. Whether the organization provided any goods or services in exchange (quid pro quo).
3. A description and good-faith estimate of the value of any goods or services provided in exchange (or a statement that only intangible religious benefits were provided).

**"Contemporaneous"** means obtained by the earlier of:
- The date you file the return for the year of contribution, or
- The due date (including extensions) for filing the return.

### Non-Cash Contributions Over $500 (Form 8283, Section A)

For total non-cash contributions exceeding **$500** during the year, you must complete and attach **Form 8283, Section A** (Noncash Charitable Contributions) to your return.

2. Complete **Form 8283, Section B**.

- **Clothing and household items:** Must be in good used condition or better. Items valued over $500 require an appraisal regardless of the $5,000 threshold.

### Qualified Appraisal Requirements

- Must be conducted no earlier than **60 days before** the date of contribution and no later than the due date (including extensions) of the return.
- Must be performed by a **qualified appraiser** (meets education and experience requirements under Reg. 1.170A-17).

## 6. Non-Cash Property: Fair Market Value (FMV) Rules

### General Rule

The amount of the deduction for donated property is generally its **fair market value (FMV)** on the date of contribution -- the price at which the property would change hands between a willing buyer and a willing seller, both having reasonable knowledge of relevant facts.

### Ordinary Income Property

If donated property would have produced **ordinary income or short-term capital gain** if sold, the deduction is limited to the property's **adjusted basis** (generally, cost).

Examples:
- Inventory
- Short-term capital gain property (held 1 year or less)
- Section 1245/1250 recapture property
- Self-created works (art, manuscripts, etc. by the creator)

### Capital Gain Property (Long-Term)

If donated property would have produced **long-term capital gain** if sold (held more than 1 year), the deduction is generally the **FMV**, subject to the 30% AGI limit.

**Exception -- Tangible Personal Property:**
If tangible personal property (e.g., artwork, collectibles) is donated to a qualified organization that uses it for a purpose **unrelated** to its exempt function, the deduction is limited to the donor's **basis** (not FMV).

### Vehicles, Boats, and Aircraft (Over $500)

For vehicles, boats, or aircraft claimed at over $500:
- If the organization **sells** the vehicle without significant use, the deduction is limited to the **gross proceeds** from the sale.
- If the organization uses or materially improves the vehicle, the deduction may be the FMV.
- The donee must provide a **Form 1098-C** (or equivalent written acknowledgment) within 30 days of the sale or contribution.

### Publicly Traded Securities

- Deduction is the FMV (mean of high and low trading prices on date of contribution).
- No appraisal required, regardless of value.
- Subject to the 30% AGI limit for long-term capital gain property.

---

## 7. Quid Pro Quo Contributions

A **quid pro quo contribution** is a payment made partly as a contribution and partly in exchange for goods or services from the donee organization.

### Rules

- Only the amount that exceeds the FMV of the goods or services received is deductible.
- Organizations receiving quid pro quo contributions of **more than $75** must provide a written disclosure statement to the donor, including:
  - A good-faith estimate of the value of goods/services provided.
  - A statement that the deductible amount is limited to the excess of the payment over the value of goods/services.

### Exceptions (Full Deduction Allowed)

The goods or services have **no significant value** if:
- The payment is $75 or less and only token items are received (e.g., bookmarks, mugs with the organization's name) with a cost to the organization of no more than $13.30 (2025).
- The payment is at least $75 and the only benefit received is an annual membership benefit with a cost of no more than $13.30.
- The contribution is $75 or more and the only benefit consists of intangible religious benefits.

## 8. Donor-Advised Funds (DAF)

A **donor-advised fund (DAF)** is a fund or account owned and controlled by a sponsoring organization (typically a public charity or community foundation) where the donor may recommend grants.

### Deductibility

- Contributions to a DAF are generally deductible in the year the contribution is made to the fund (not when the DAF makes grants to charities).
- The contribution must be to a qualified **sponsoring organization** (a 501(c)(3) public charity).
- Subject to the same AGI limits as other contributions to public charities (60% for cash, 30% for capital gain property).

### Restrictions

Contributions to a DAF are **not** deductible if:
- The sponsoring organization is a war veterans' organization, fraternal society, or nonprofit cemetery company.
- The donor does not receive an acknowledgment that the sponsoring organization has **exclusive legal control** over the assets contributed.
- The DAF makes a grant to an individual or non-qualified entity.

### Substantiation

- Standard substantiation rules apply ($250+ CWA requirement).
- The acknowledgment must state that the organization has exclusive legal control over the contributed assets.

---

## 9. Conservation Easements

A **qualified conservation contribution** is a contribution of a qualified real property interest (typically a conservation easement) to a qualified organization exclusively for conservation purposes.

### Requirements

- The contribution must be of a **restriction in perpetuity** on the use of real property.
- The donee must be a **qualified organization** with the resources to monitor and enforce the conservation restrictions.
- The conservation purpose must be one of:
  - Preservation of land for public outdoor recreation or education
  - Protection of a natural habitat
  - Preservation of open space (including farmland and forest land) for scenic enjoyment or pursuant to government conservation policy
  - Preservation of a historically important land area or certified historic structure

### Deduction Amount

- Generally the FMV of the easement (difference between FMV of the property before and after the restriction).
- Subject to **special AGI limits:** Qualified conservation contributions by individuals are generally limited to **50% of AGI** minus other charitable contributions (with a 15-year carryforward). Qualified farmers and ranchers may deduct up to **100% of AGI**.

### Enhanced Scrutiny

The IRS has increased enforcement of syndicated conservation easement transactions.
Syndicated transactions (where investors purchase partnership interests primarily for
inflated conservation easement deductions) are listed transactions and subject to penalties.

## 11. Special Rules and Elections

### Appreciated Property Election

For capital gain property donated to a 50% limit organization, the donor may elect to
reduce the contribution amount to the property's **adjusted basis** (instead of FMV).
This changes the AGI limit from 30% to 50%. The election applies to **all** capital gain
property donated during the year.

### Partial Interest Rule

Generally, a deduction is not allowed for a contribution of less than the donor's entire
interest in the property. Exceptions include:

- Undivided fractional interest in the entire property
- Remainder interest in a personal residence or farm
- Qualified conservation contribution
- Contributions to charitable remainder trusts, charitable lead trusts, or pooled income funds

### Out-of-Pocket Expenses for Volunteers

Unreimbursed expenses incurred while serving as a volunteer are deductible:

- 14 cents per mile (2025) for use of a personal vehicle in service to the charity.
- Travel expenses (transportation, lodging) while away from home on behalf of the charity (no significant element of personal vacation).
